"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"wow Google it's amazing app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Pretty basic. Can use my calendar better or even my notes or my reminder or my Alexa app and all those do the exact same functions and some even better. At least notes has different colors and spacing and indent. Nothing special or collaborative or linked or synced. In some ways it was kind of annoying because I had a task that was in the future but was showing everyday and for a visual person like me who likes a clean and cleared checklist it made it look like I had stuff still to do every day."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Am at , Great! 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It's weird that search engine Google doesn't offer search for its lists in Tasks. You can't even sort alphabetically, despite the inclusion of a sort feature. This app is a strange combination of minimalism & compromised utility. It used to be good at being a stripped down task list but it's not even that now with the forced visibility of completed dates doubling the length of lists. In some ways this app is good but in others it sucks for the reason of stupidity. I mean, get it together, Google"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helpfull"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simplicity = Productivity"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"amazing app very straight to the point use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The app used to be reliable, reminding of tasks according to the designated day and time. Over the last 3 months or so, I have not received one push notification for my tasks until after I have opened the app via the icon. Time to move on to something else."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Boo-Yah!!... ""The proof is in the pudding"" as they say; & Google has (ONCE AGAIN) outdone themselves."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It is very important to create an update that contains an option to have and modify the notification sound that the device produces for the task reminders. As of now, and on my most recent 3 phones, reminders that I have set have had zero sound when notifying me and, therefore, had been very ineffective at performing a successful task reminder to me. I did try going to app settings, and 'allow sound notifications' is on, but zero sound options are linked to it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Good app on general, but need more notifications options. It would be nice for them to last longer. Bizarre choice for them to expire /.fail to presis, which seems to be the opposite of every other Android app, and makes no sense for reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"lacks basic but critical features, including no shared lists no natural language recognition for dates when entering tasks, and no tags"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"👍🏻🙂"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A real help in breaking down time and creating routines."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"For a tasks app, this is very basic, and lacks features that other free apps include by default. For example: There's no text formatting. I'd like to see text formatting included, such as bold, italics, size, font, colour etc. That's a basic requirement, especially these days when technology is as advanced as it is. I'd also like to be able to set custom alarms for the reminders, and set them directly from within the task editor. Highlighting tasks is another basic requirement."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Not bad"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"please add function remider"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"does not work all the time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"very good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very succinctly built & cross-platform"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Recommended"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"App does not automatically notify its alert on calendar or time set if the app is not kept open (or alert notification does not operate well if it is not running in the background).

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great 😊"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"its really good . and easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"When it works, I quite like it. However, approximately 20% of the time, it just fails to give me notifications at all, which kinda defeats the point of scheduling tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"not getting notifications"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Constantly fails to notify of tasks at the scheduled time despite battery optimization being ignored and all other permissions granted. It's a solid app otherwise, but this is a critical flaw."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Garbage, the reminders never push through, I used to rely on the old reminders system to remind me of everything, now this app made it to where I miss a bunch of things cause notifications of reminders never push through.."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I came from iOS, used Things3 and was looking for an android alternative. This is simple enough and decently aesthetic, but lacks the overall polish and functionality of Things. To be fair though, that is by far the best to do app on the market, so it's probably an unfair comparison. I will keep using this until Things comes to android, if it ever does."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Very good app. The only thing that is missing to deserve more stars is the possibility to join a picture to a task. Right now I just add see pictures in the details section, but it would be amazing if I could do it within the app itself. However I will keep on using this app because it is one of the best one I found so far."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"If you want to miss your appointments this app is a godsend. I've set it up on three Android devices to date and on two of them it required inane fiddling and digging around in settings to get reminder notifications to appear at all. Of course the ap, super pages, etc don't have anything to help and you are reliant on random advice on reddit. The best news of all is that, on android 13, the battery optimization disable setting that fixed this app seems to be gone and notifications never appear!"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy way to track spontaneous to do"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please, please restore the ability to directly access any list from a drop-down menu like the available reorder list menu. This would be very helpful & time saving, especially if you have many lists which you now must tediously swipe through until you find the one you want to select. This is my most used, favorite app, but it's more difficult to use efficiently now."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The app idea is good, but it's not integrated well with calendar or email. So i usually forget to use the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I wish it didn't delete items that have been done. I'd rather it was crossed off or box was cjecked."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good way to list things to do"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Great app but I wish subtasks are modified in mobile version like web app. When I assign subtasks it appears as standalone task instead of being under the main task in the main view.

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"wish fhére was an alarm mm"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Enjoyed the simplicitynand usability of the app. But please add the option to see tasks from every category all at once and to see events from the calendar app in the tasks widget. And also, the subtasks are showing separate when they are not given any time stamp while the main task is overdue. You can make it like, if the time stamp is not given , then use parent task's time. If these problems are solved, then it is a 5 star."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"perfect"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The best"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great little app, but I'm still missing the GTD functionality (projects etc) which came with iOS only Omnifocus. It's easy to get lost in a jumble of lists."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Please provide a widget just for tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Simple and useful app, but the widget doesn't follow the rest of Google/Androids design language or color pallet. Ugly, but Gemini/Assistant use it so I guess I'll deal"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Yet again, Google Tasks app fails to remind me of a reminder I literally asked it less than an hour ago to remind me to do. Does not work as well as the old reminders. I will consistently find myself not being reminded of the tasks that I ask Google Assistant to remind me of at a certain hour and then sometimes it'll remind me three four hours or days later! What makes it worse is Google assistant has no other option for reminders except this app!"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app keeps having issues with notification. It stops sending notifications after being updated. It's useless if a task app does not send user notifications. It should be a basic feature and priority when you make updates to the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Didn't trigger at time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"There should be a planned list which shows all of your planned task as per their due date like microsoft todo. We also cannot attach any file for the proof of task completion. Currently we have to look for each list separately for due tasks. We can't even archive the task once all the associated task completed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"بهتر بود مثل to do مایکروسافت و یا reminder سامسونگ بخش‌هایی داشت که کارهای امروز، انجام شده و غیره رو به‌طور جداگانه نشون می‌داد. الان اگر بخوام مثلا صبح ببینم کل روز اخیانا چه کارهایی دارم اصلا مشخص نمی‌شه مگر اینکه تقویم گوگل رو باز کنم و اونجا تو بخش زمان‌بندی‌ بتونم بفهمم. ولی تو reminder سامسونگ خیلی راحت و خودکار کارهای امروزم تو تو بخش جدا نشون میده که خیلی کمک‌کننده‌ست."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Yo no sé cuándo inventaron esta aplicación pero la descubrí apenas la semana pasada. Tengo déficit de atención e hiperactividad y no había conseguido en mi vida estrategia alguna para poder implementar recordatorios o alarmas. En el reloj colocaba alarmas y luego no sabía a qué me refería. Si usaba cuadernos un día lo escribía y otro día no. o lo escribía y luego lo olvidaba.

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I've tried numerous ways to improve my efficiency including this app apparently, but I can't find a way to get even missed calls or messages to stand out any more than some stupid new video on YouTube or a post on Instagram that I could care less about. My old dumb flip phone would make a noise until I responded to a new message, but now every single app wants me to turn on notifications with the effect being I ignore ALL notifications. So I didn't remember creating Tasks, forgot it existed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Needs a more modern interface"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Not sure if it's from an update, but I'm not getting notifications for a LOT of tasks/reminders.. Some of these are critical and I rely on them to work. Like taking my epilepsy meds so I don't have a seizure. Please fix this! I'll have to find another app if it's not very soon."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"not enough privacy, the reminders suck, it isn't encrypted"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great way to track stuff"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best task scheduler, just needs a bit more love. I'm thinking: tags, search, filtering. Then the ability to add notifications like for events."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like it 👍🏼"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app, very useful to track your personal projects and pending tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"great tool to get basic everyday tasks done"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's Easy and Simple which helps to set goals easily"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Was 4 stars, but loses 2 stars for making Share of webpage to Tasks, my primary use case, slow and clunky. Worse, It does not follow Calendar for the day which starts the week, which is confusing and error prone. Arrggghhhh!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It feels like it lacks some standard features. Main one I really really would like to have added is being able to share and coordinate on certain lists. For example grocery lists or lists for work flow. I do prefer it over Keep for my lists although keep is still superior for notes. One other big thing I run into as well is not being to manually sort the stared list, only automatically by date or order in which is was stared."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good, but would be nice to be able to sort alphabetically and to use bulleted lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice assistance"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Hey, Google... How about Tasks using the same ""First day of the week"" that is set up in Calendar? Or at least having an option to set it manually. Do you have any idea how focused we have to be when creating Tasks when Tasks is the only app on your phone that starts the week with Sunday?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The reminder don't come up on time. Many times it will be 30 to 40 minutes later consistently. Sometimes only comes up if you open the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"wonderful 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"For planning"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app, finally added the option to reorganized the main tabs placement."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Tasks doesn't make any notification sound or pop-up."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"🌶️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"didn't give an alarm when the task was due."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"didn't alert me when I asked Gemini to remind me of a task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice tracking important task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great tool! Use it all the time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The interface is easy to navigate, and the horizontal slide is a great way to keep longer lists next to each other. I have weekly routine tasks , as well as different project based tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love, Love, Love. Helps me keep up with my everyday stuff."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very helpful w the widget! My own personal ""honey, do"" list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The simplicity ... 🔥"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It took a while but I finally migrated all my Google tasks to a new task app. I didn't realize how bad Tasks was even before Google ruined it last year, compared to modern task tracking apps."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It would be great if it could be paired with Samsung Reminder."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like it. I can easily set reminders for anything."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I've heard rumours! Please don't kill the standalone Tasks app. I struggle with ADHD, and I'd love to be able to hide individual lists so that my daily routine doesn't clog up my calendar of REAL important events. I really love the integration with Chromebook as well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very good start and very useful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So far so good. No complain on this app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google Tasks App 4 Androids. I'm downloading this App, 2 help me pay my unpaid bills from Novant Health. This will be a good Tool for me. Thank you, Google team & Novant Health Bill payment System. Sandy Trail!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"This is a good app for making or scheduling tasks though some new features should be introduced like different Colour for different tasks, Task Repeat According to date wise should be different like Can create with batch for different dates together and should show us for different dates. Also the End Time option should be there for every task. And Yaa Many More as Per Requirements......"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"بستخدمه علي طول بيساعدك في تنظيم كافة جوانب الحياة"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"the notifications stop after a while. it ok but needs some bugs worked out. I thought this would help me with procrastinating. fix the bugs."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"handy to do list... love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"not enough features but does the job"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"What I use on a daily basis. Quick, Simple, integrates with Gmail etc. Recommended."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"THIS APP IS MISSING THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE, TO MAKE NOISE WHEN IT NOTIFIES YOU OF A REMINDER!!! My ADHD mind can't function without a sound or strong vibration of my phone catching my attention when a reminder comes in. I have 50 million notifications from other apps as is. The Task notifications are so tiny and do not make noise, so how will I ever see them??? Please fix this. The Reminder app in the Galaxy store is a perfect example of an app that allows you to set sound for notifications"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Amazing for keeping track of tasks and you can even have a widget on your home screen."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very good I need it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good application 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I use this app for anything list related. very easy interface and syncs across devices"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google Tasks is an awesome app. Everything you need can be gotten with or without any extra pressure."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"update user interface"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"no notifications pushed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I am a very organized individual, so having this app is helpful, and handy with features~!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Need to learn more about it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"This is a good app for arranging your tasks and prioritizing things. But I wish Google would make this app/task shareable with family members so that you can set tasks for other family members. You can share your YouTube, Google Maps, and other Google products, so why can't we do it with Google Tasks? It would be great to set tasks for my kids."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"App is almost completely not customizable and ignores phone settings. Despite having every option on for alerts all I get is a sound and a notification in my top bar. The only feature that works properly is that gemini refuses to use anything but this God awful broken system, even if I have the app uninstalled."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"بسیار کاربردی و به درد بخور برای برنامه ریزی کارهای روزانه و هفتگی سریع، روان و ساده👌"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Very useful for keeping on track but occasionally does not notify me sometimes which can really mess up my plans if I forgot something. I would avoid it for super important reminders and only use it for minor tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"even after giving permission i don't get notifications until I open the app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Just another way to stalk you see what you are planning what you doing etc etc"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's keeping this ADHD dude reasonably on schedule. and that is a miracle!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This app is great! It is very helpful, but I wish you could add a separate notification sound, strictly for this app. My best suggestion to fix this issue, would be to put a setting in the app, so you can set a certain notification sound strictly for this app other than that, this app is perfect for me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"so beautiful app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Task app runs very well but it needs further improvements like it is necessary to include notification sound and alarm also, this will improve its performance. Thanks Google Tasks and Google."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like it but if there was a week and this month and week and month number, it was fantastic, I suggest google to mix that with google calendar in addition remove the options in google account, i mean people should add account by their own choice, thank you."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great Companion"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Love it but wish for more options Updating review...Thank you for more options.:-)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's great but needs to be available on samsung watch as well"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Widget always failed if the phone use a launcher! Somehow the widget don't show anything! But work fine if don't using a launcher. I have try many launcher including Microsoft launcher still widget doesn't work!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A great app for simple task management that syncs with Google Calendar. Not as full featured as other dedicated ToDo apps but that can be a benefit if you want straightforward and easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"There is no scope to collaborate making it almost useless for business purposes"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"really helps me manage my day. so easy to use and available on all my devices"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"App is good. However, the widget is awfully basic, the main issue being it has no transparency settings. Quick Google search reveals this is a common gripe with users. Please Devs add this function."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I've not used this app very much. I'm hoping to find it performs well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Recently this app has done the complete opposite and hasn't been reminding me of anything. No notifications or anything."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"This app is very basic and it is just to create Task List is not a Task Manager. If it was it would be the best with Google calendar. I wish it had more features like Do Today view, or schedule view and put all the task that are do today and you wouldn't have to move them or find them on each list. Also that could do more in list like edit color to each list like keep and add headers to create sub list and much more. This app has potential but Idk why Google doesn't invest more development to it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's going to be a great year"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app Doesn't work properly"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I need a tasker that can have reminders set in hour intervals."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Task is very user friendly 👍💥💯🔥"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love your product. keep shining, you all"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Notifications wouldn't work. Thought it would make tasks in Google Calender smoother, but it instead made it a train wreck as I wasn't receiving notifications for my tasks, even after troubleshooting."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"light and easy as everything by Google. useful to help remember little tasks or quick groceries."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"couldn't live without my reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"podia ter a opção ""não fazer"" para contabilizar o que não foi feito no momento adequado"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's really simple and that's its selling point for me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It seems to do what it's supposed to. However, there is no way to export a list conveniently."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I have a hard time using it and it's such a good feature to have. I love Google but that task app feels almost simplistic to me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"combine calendar and tasks app or make them separate but you can link dated/timed tasks to calendar. I'm missing the done check mark function on the calendar. I'm not able to specially layout my tasks in the calendar....... let me explain. I think of time same as space same as oxygen left in a tank. so watches with hands work for me when I'm running and gunning in 15 min increments because I can look at my hand watch and specially understand what I have left, like a video game health bar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use with reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"so helpful! and user friendly"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"All sorts of notifications are on with it, but still often fails to alert me!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"one of the best App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"hcould have better alarms and or reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good app . Hope it is easy Link to google assistant , google home and google calendar . ask assistant sometimes it doesn't tell me what I write in a Google task message......"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app, convenient"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Cleanest app with the functions I need (ability to have multiple lists, ability to move bullet points up and down the list) that I've used so far."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's a great app that I love!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"There's no search 🔎 button. A default task list missing. Location based tasks are missing. There's no way to attach a file, etc to the task. Bring back the family reminders If I wish to sort a task list as per date, alphabetically it should sync universally to every device having tasks app.. Right now the same has to be done separately in each device"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"20 years of tasks to delete and no way to delete except one at a time. :("
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"better hai"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"For the most part it's helpful, but it could have better notifications."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"What good is the reminders function if it doesn't work."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great job"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"not smart"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Notification not coming for the tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I missing GTD in this app. Nirvana implemented GTD. But some glitches are there. If Google implemented GTD that will be most useful one for me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Google Tasks is useful but has great potential for growth. Adding AI for task suggestions, subtasks for daily tasks, project sharing, and dedicated macOS/Windows apps would enhance productivity. Pomodoro timers, relaxing focus sounds, custom repeatable alarms with vibration, and voice reminders would help users with ADHD. An advanced search and flexible scheduling would make it even better. A premium option could support these improvements and take it to the next level."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I want more task parameters. Advanced mode."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works great for staying on task and complete multiple things in a scheduling processed day"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it's not bad but could be better, if I'm not mistaken there currently is no way to set a reminder for when arriving at a destination, which I do so miss, but not regardless not bad at all"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great application for creating & managing my tasks for the day!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It would be great of the app displayed the number of days until and since an event is due or was set."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this app used in partnership with Google calendar is a game changer. thank you!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"i hope it's just integrated with google notes"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"fine"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"best app ever"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Needs a transparency option for the widget"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very functional app.Alerts appear on time and app has many features."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"If a timing alarm alert is provided in this app it will be 👍 great."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good for tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Large widget is broken and will not load. S23 Ultra Android 14"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"working perfectly for me 👍 👌 exalent!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google Tasks is perfect for managing those last-minute to-dos that don't belong on my calendar. The intuitive format and layout make it so much easier to stay organized than creating calendar events."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Why did Google decided to remove the sharing option from this app? The most useful thing in a family context is to be able to share boards and assign tasks to your family members. So much stupidity. It's in moments like that I need to commend Apple."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great value 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I can set goals and achieve them i have a reminder"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"help I have to do a lot of homework"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"keeps me on track."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google Tasks integrated nicely with their calendar to keep things organized and on track."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very simple and straight to the point, easy to add and edit tasks. Even syncs with Google calendar for even more versatility. Hassle free to do lists without all the clutter and distractions of other features that aren't used on a frequent basis. 10/5 stars"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Half the time it doesn't send notifications."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it's ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Need alarm ring for Task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is productivity apps thanks google inc..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Hello to my future wife! 😄"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good one"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"wish you could set priorities and move things including sub tasks... but it's really good at what it does do."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best of Bests"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great to use nice and clean"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Real help with my medicine schedule"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"One of the worst. Hard to believe professionals made this when it can't even implement a way to delete all tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So far, this has been very helpful ."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"goood as fuak"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"love access on multiple platforms"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple but exactly what I needed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good App. Helps me to stay on task and get things done."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Good for only basic task management. You can't add attachments. You can't get a view of only the main task titles; all sub-tasks are shown in the view as well, making it very cluttered. Good integration with Calendar. Sadly the capabilities of this do not touch those of Microsoft To Do, so I don't need migrating just yet"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It should be more fun to add images voice notes and graphics and gifs"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"smooth working fine as per my need Just Great 👍🏻"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice app 🤠"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"recommended"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I didnt hear it remind me sometimes"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It allows multiple lists on different accounts. I can keep a record of all the things I need to do and when I need to do them. Highly recommend it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this is great especially now that some Gemini models have access to Google umbrella info!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Really loving this tool! Introduced the rest of my company to it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent app helps me stay organised"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Simple app, works great! A useful feature to add would be to allow start and end time for tasks, like events in google calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"superb app.. best app used so far. so satisfying"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's is very helpful for someone that truly uses technology to organize their life. and the fact that when impn my desktop it shows up along side my calendar. very helpful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I've tried so many task management solutions but I keep coming back to task because it is truly multiplatform and you can add tasks through Gemini."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Comparison to Apple Reminders as a former iPhone user. - Lacks smart lists and the tag feature, which lets you tag reminders, and when said tag is selected on the smart list, only the reminders containing that tag are shown.l - Lacks more features to better detail your reminders, like attachments like image fields and url-only fields - Doesn't have priority features, where setting a reminder as low, medium, or high priority adds an exclamation mark next to the title"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great quality app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Please give feature like date and time of task creation."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"does not send notifications"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"there is no notification"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's fine but it needs location based reminders added."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple and easy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"notifications delay reminder is sometimes delayed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Standalone app that also integrates with your Google profile. Clear UI that keeps things simple."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"NICE"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's a Friendly Reminder,...You Smile!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Worst"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"As I have come to expect... it works great. Clean and functional and it integrates with all of my other Google stuff. Perfect. This is all I needed to complete my vision, how it is I wanted to use my calendar features. Cool."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this is my new favorite app to stay on top of everything.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I I do not use it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Cannot manually reorder tasks with my browser(says app does not support my browser). Here we go again (Goggle vs MIcrosoft)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No search in this app at all is egregious. Also you can't set defaults (daily, weekly, etc.) for repeating options. Can't add pictures to tasks. Still don't understand why Google brought this app back. Tasks should have died when Google Keep came out. Pointless to have both."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"ultimate"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Why there is no search buttons Please update Ur app it's an very expired app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Annoying that you can't either order tasks by dragging them, and that you can't tell it to order tasks after/below previously entered ones. When I enter tasks, the most important go in first; but the app pushes them to the bottom, and off the screen. This is bad UI."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this Application, thanks Google"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"😀"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I think it's take to time response."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"the best tasks manager when you have google account"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"tasks are so easy to keep track of what you need to do on a daily basis! It's a great tool to have !"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Can't create a shared task list, which makes it pretty useless as a todo app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Pretty good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"OMG, LOVE IT! Who needs paper i have cur my use of paper so much"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"it's not performing well"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"not getting any notifications from this app anymore. work is getting affected."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The most effective tool for time management. I can create different lists as well as sub lists. Plus, the option of a reminder helps as it sends notifications for any planned tasks and it also allows to keep the task running for a definite period of time where it will send daily, weekly, monthly or yearly reminders ( like a phone alarm). Best app to make your to do lists as well as remember important events."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very useful application. Just must remember to look at it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Since switching to Tasks I no longer receive Android Notifications about my reminders. This means, if I'm on my way home from work and have set a reminder to pick up the groceries, I won't see the notification until I disconnect from Android Auto. Usually when I get home. 👎🏻"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The widget has disappeared."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good but it should be more synchronised across devices"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful, no complaints!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"revised app is excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"LOVE this app! I came from all Apple and this is way more user friendly. Haven't missed a task since I've downloaded it!! Thanks google!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I find it super handy to remind me of upcoming things. I'm not exactly a power user though."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Lacks basic functionality. Needs Search. Needs options to change notification sounds, task colors, etc. Needs support for Wear OS Watch, and ability to import/export/display of tasks from other apps (similar to calendars). Needs ability to move tasks and subtasks and repeating tasks between lists. Doesn't display when a task was completed, only when it was due. Needs a mode to display all tasks at once."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Didn't work"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very easy to update daily routine"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Why I can't add , color to tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I'm really liking the new Tasks feature on the Samsung S25 Ultra. It's very seamless & intuitive."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"गजब है"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It make life easier! No paper work!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"i expecting an update fiture for adding a deadline time, hopefully its added soon! thanks, great app!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Google Tasks is a simple and effective task management tool that seamlessly integrates with the Google ecosystem. Its minimalist design makes it easy to use, and its cross-platform accessibility ensures you can manage your tasks from anywhere. While it may lack some advanced features found in other task management apps, it's a great option for individuals and teams who need a basic and free solution for task organization."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Falling way behind Samsung reminders and Microsoft to do."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"organized as a iPhone without the cost of the extras.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helps me so much in daily life remember things"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps keep our activities up to date"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good so far"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is a request, not a review. Now that Google has some very very useful apps like this, they should also roll out a launcher app and it should be simialr to Microsoft Launcher. Personally I like Microsoft Launcher because of its Glance feature and also due to how easily I can use search bar for multiple purposes. Also app layout is also very clean. I hope Google will launch something similar for Google app users."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it's good for study 😁"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"WONDERFUL"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Cannot integrate with CALDAV tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Don't know how to move tasks to other lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"to do list is working thus app but ur still litt"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"combine notes , tasks and reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Why don't you guys add the sharing aspect to be able to collaborate. This will offer the only thing it misses. And it will be the most perfect app. Then incorporate the same functionality in Google calendar. Like, just like in calendars where you can create a calendar and share, the same with tasks, create a task and share. Incorporate the same in calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I am only able to sign in to my school account via my learning device and not my phone for some reason and I am thus unable to track my homework etc...hopefully you can resolve this issue asap (but other than that this app is really helpful in tracking things I need to do for school :)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please give more short by options like ascending and descending orders by the tasks added."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"How do you add a sound notification?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful and easy to use, I can clearly focus on my task and track my pending deliverables and progress, I also like the cross out function which motivates me to continue my task as I feel good with these simple milestones once I'm done with the task and crossing it out"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent... Synchronises with Google calendar, so all tasks will appear automatically. Thank you Google 😊"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Worthy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"could use a little more alert. I have a tendency to ignore the sound."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it, use it daily 😀"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I believe this app is falling behind other task apps, such as Microsoft To Do and the Samsung Reminder app. 1.Task notifications pop up like simple alerts. There should be an option to mark a task as important, which would change the notification type accordingly. 2. Tasks use the default notification tone on my Galaxy device. It would be helpful to have a distinct sound to differentiate task alerts from random messages. 3. Sometimes there are no notification sounds."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"really great app that intergrade with Google Kalender only thin missing is to either have a family task's list or to be able to share task or assign task to Member"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's really the best App Google has ever made. simple with remainders too"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's so helpful. If you are busy with your hands and you remember something that you need to do, hey Google open tasks!!! Simplicity at its best!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The app is buggy. I've set two notifications thus far to test and I don't receive notifications at the set time. Unreliable"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I wish this app was completely free, I mean, why do I have to pay for an upgraded version of a tasks app???? Other than that it's very functional"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Notifications stopped working for edited/updated tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"sometimes reminds me. sometimes doesn't. very frustrating."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good app for organizing ur task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I'm not getting any reminder"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"*This is a feature request* Please add the ability to change the colour of tasks in Google Tasks. At the moment the only colour is ""blue"". Ideally also allow the tasks colour to be dictated by the list you assign them to I.e. define colours by task list/group. This would be a fantastic productivity improvement. I can see it has been requested in various forums for a while, but has yet to be implemented"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great easy platform to navigate"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"What a disaster this has been.... I'm madI even gotta give one star. I have to find a new reminder app because this one is completely broken... What good is a reminder app that doesn't remind you until hours after it's supposed to? Google is slipping hard these days and it sucks 😢 Gemini is terrible too"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"best"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's good but in my opinion it's just a glorified checklist with tabs. I like Microsoft's To Do and Tasks app much better"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is My favorite site for my upgrade My work."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"my favorite daily app to organize my tasks!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"that typical software ""techie"" common sense thing that is always missing. a task tool where there is no ability to search tasks. integration with google calendar is good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"outstanding. needs a couple more features though like colors representing priority"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I can depend on"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"notifications are not regular"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"App is pointless, every task also goes onto the calendar, if I wanted them clogging up the calendar I would put them there myself. All this app does is create a 2nd notification. Just dumb!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"notifications don't show up on phone even when this is set to on. reminder notifications are duplicated from Google calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Clean, easy, basic and efficient; Just like my ex."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It stopped sending me reminders and I have to open the task app for them to start populating. Google stop breaking things! You used to be awesome what happened."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Hey, I hope the developer reading this. I love this app. It works well with gemini so I can just say my task. BUT, if I may ask for improvement, please makes it works with GOOGLE MAPS. If I want to make a task, for example, ""Please remind me to clean the house when I got home."" And I've set the home location so once it knows I'm home, the task appears. That would be a lifesaver! Please, thank you!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"brilliant app for keeping track of small daily tasks and ADHD friendly."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"great app! should have a search bar to find tasks more easily."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"no alarms no notifications youre better with phone alarm or using paper and pen"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Extremely simple, but simple is Google's way and it works"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It makes lists. Very basic and useful."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Pnly thing to make it better: ability to share tasks with others/add tasks to shared family calendar. 😁"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"add search for notes please add search button to search my notes i have many notes and keep new"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good app. Wish it could sort more."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Basic, simple, and I can add a widget in my home screen so I never forget any task 👍🏼 I installed it because I use Google assistant to write those tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Show sub-tasks so I can remember what they are"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is the best app for tasks and even notes, and for me, after experimenting i found myself better organized using Tasks rather than Keep."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy way to organize your life."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great way to keep on track of all your to do's."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"keeps me on schedule"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great. It helps me keep up with things"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"1 star because the app permission to send notifications was off by default. This hidden setting is especially confusing since it's separate from the notification permissions. No wonder I was missing so many events. This is an odd choice by Google especially when using a pixel phone that has these apps installed by default."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Please, add setting for the star of the week, I want my week to start from monday. It puzzles me every time I love this app anyways"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice and simple to do list. Easy to use. You can sort tasks by due dates. Would be nice if there was an option to have undated tasks at the beginning of the list, above the dated tasks. Still - very well done Google."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Gets the job done and works with Gemini"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it! it keeps me knowledgeable about what bills and events etc. that I have coming up. Great idea for this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Finally a simple handy task list with no extra details and to the point design, thanks googlees"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Not working on Android 8.1 😔"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very nice app.. useful for all day to day activities 👍 😀 👌"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"very limited functionality,"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"best app for revise your goal"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The only reason I wanted this was to share a list with my husband, but it seems I've been misled and that's not a feature available. What's the point of this app when i can just make a simple list in a notes app? This adds no value. Deleting"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Perfect app for staying on task. I use this as my daily to-do list. Most tasks I set up as ""daily recurring."" That way, when something out of the ordinary happens, I can handle that... then go back to my list to see what I still need to do. (Workout, Read for 30 minutes, Walk Dog, etc."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"really helps with people with the with my forgetfulness"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this is a great app because you can put in as much information or as little information as you want for any task. so if it's important I'll put a date on it that way it also shows up on my calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This application manages my priorities very well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good application 😃"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good work"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simply to use, a great memory jogger."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"lacking hourly filter capabilities, I get overwhelmed and stressed if I see all tasks even though I can totally do 50 of them (I need that many cause I am similar to an Alzheimer patient, can't remember anything)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, goes along with the calendar app I already use an like, and does what it's supposed to do. Very helpful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"could use some additional features like having smart options where tasks can be automatically triggered"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"perfect!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Please add list category (title, color or icon) on the right side of starred task so we can identify which list is the task in the starred tab. Thank you!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Can't make multiple notifications for 1 task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"zor chiqibti prilojeniya"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helps me keep my tasks in mind and get them all done. I'm so much more productive thanks to this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Simple enough to track tasks and notes, but also feature rich. The only thing I would ask for is a search feature. I can only use Control+F (Find) on a desktop browser. I don't know. Maybe I have too many lists and too many tasks in each list and I wouldn't need ""search"" if I had less content. I would highly recommend this pretty easy app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I wish there was an option to view all the categorized tasks lists in one list. Instead of having to use Google Calendar app to view what's on my today's to-do lists (My Google Tasks for that day). I like it to be organized but sometimes I want to view so it's in one day especially since I have more than two lists. (5 actually) Please make this a feature. 🙏"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's a good scheduling platform"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"really a life saver"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Why do I need a dedicated app? When I can do a Google reminder through the assistant and still get reminded as well as have it show up on my calendar as a task. As for an issue with using the app: when I create a task I cannot directly set it to a certain list. I have to go into the app and manually change it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I miss simple reminders. Not everything is a task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Like 💯"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"need nagging notification"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"👌👌 एप्प"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app to keep on top of tasks and to pre plan the day, week or year ahead."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"A good start, but will be much better with extra customisation such as different colour lists, widgets etc"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This works really well for daily & weekly reminders, and for jobs I keep putting off. The ability to mark a task complete from the notification is essential, because in the app itself, the text ""mark completed"" appears behind the menu button. Somebody didn't pay attention to the UI frame guidelines…"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I set up reminders and they don't work. They don't go off at the right time. I want to give it Zero stars."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"No option to show all task lists in widget, only one, useless."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I can't seem to find a way to make this app give more assertive notifications. All it does is a single short vibration that is easy to miss and no follow up reminders if the task is not checked off. This is the biggest thing holding back Gemini as an assistant."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very useful yet simple 👌"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"the BEST"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Reminder quality should be updated"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"worst app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It fails to make a reminder on display."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's very helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it. Simple, clean, and solid."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This is a decent app but the interface needs updating and it could use a little more functionality like the ability to see more than one account in the task list."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"when I set a reminder it doesn't pop up anymore. it just goes on my calendar. worthless. I used to use this all the time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"For me this app works well at listing my tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I didn't expected this from Google, to not getting notifications on time. Purely surprised because each and every setting I liked but Actual purpose of downloading is getting notifications and it's not giving on right time and it's Randomly giving it's sucks 😔. Purely disappointed. Can anyone tell best replacement of this app even though settings are different I want notifications on time??"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Is there a way to search keywords among all my notes? I misplaced a task somewhere lol"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps alot with keeping my routine."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Honestly such a nice app that's almost made redundant by the fact that I can't share tasks within my family circle of Google accounts. How is this not implemented? I will use this app so much less now because this one feature isn't present."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"_exellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"OK 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Learning new information and how to plan and use it to improve my ministry."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"pointless as you can't share with others without more apps. Put it all under one app and make it actually useful Google."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Pretty easy to understand app. I like how you can make multiple lists but I would like to see an option to move the task to the next day. Or it's already on there I just haven't figured it out yet"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Stop your headache, start moving!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A great way to keep reminders whether it's just a one-time, daily, weekly, or monthly"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"An easy to use Task/Reminder App. It does what you need but I'd suggest a few improvements. Long Press to Delete Long Press & Hold to Arrange Allow us to add Subtasks to Repeating Tasks As a Samsung Owner, I'd like to see a collab between tasks and Reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I do not receive notifications reliably."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"the theme is just really simple, without any tutorial you can understand everything in this app, and it's already really helpfull"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"subpar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"copy task would be a cooler option"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Not bad, but how can this Task App have no view für ""due tasks by data""?!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"very often there is no notification when IT SHOULD!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple. Exactly what I needed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app for simple to-dos. But it would be great to have shared lists for sharing with family"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It seem to be use full having try to it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It used to be helpful when notifications worked. Now I just get inundated with notifications, when I open the app. I need the notifications. That's why I set tasks to different dates and time of day. It's useless to me without those notifications."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"wish it was a little bit more robust with features, location, services, etc. it's a little to vanilla"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Does what you expect"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I'm relatively new at this. As we mature, and recent memories are not as dominant as they used to be, aving a strong ally like google tasks gives us a better chance of fulfilling our contacts needs. I highly recommend giving this app a try."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"more work on calling assistant can't hear at once"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I'm interested in the app. Right now I have decided to use it for submitting short articles and keep my work in future.please help others who don't know what is going on. I give it five stars.keep up guys."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"super mega practica"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google task is cool, i recommend to modify the application a little bit, when the small circle on the left is pressed, it should prompt the confirmation box for removal, it should not remove the task momentarily as you press the circle. Farewell."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good 😊👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Simple, i like it! I don't like that the widget shows reminders that are my months in the future though. Would be enough if it turned up like a day before"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I've used this for ages and found it very useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"has no option to create tasks for the members of my google family. you'd think that'd be fairly basic for a tasks app, adding other people, even just the option to assign who it'd be for. no the closest to that is create a task list designated as that person. so not that useful when there's better apps for free that do more."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's a simple to use to do application. This makes it useful to me. I use it to keep track of my errands that I need to run for my family. I also use it for work to remember very important things that I would have forgotten."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google Tasks: A Seamless and Efficient Task Management Tool The Google Tasks app is a powerful, intuitive tool that helps users stay organized and manage their daily tasks with ease. One of its standout features is its integration with other Google services, particularly Gmail and Google Calendar, making it easy to add tasks directly from your inbox or set deadlines that sync with your calendar. The user interface is simple yet effect with a easy-to-navigate design."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"great app so far. I don't use it a lot but it seems to so what I need it to so far."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Waiyan"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"would be perfect with search feature"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The Google Tasks app is simple and efficient for managing to-do lists, but it lacks a key feature that would greatly enhance its functionality, the ability to attach pictures, pages, or quotations to specific tasks. This is especially frustrating when working on tasks that require visual references or additional context. While the app is great for basic task tracking, it falls short when it comes to more detailed or multimedia-rich needs. It would be a game-changer if this features were added."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"not get any notification on task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Firstly, I've noticed that subtasks created under a main task are displayed as untimed, separate tasks outside the main task in the task list. This presentation makes it difficult to see the association and hierarchy between tasks and subtasks at a glance, which can be confusing, especially when managing multiple tasks and subtasks. Secondly, this issue seems to be related to another functionality concerning repeated tasks. Currently, it appears that tasks set to repeat do not allow for subtask"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great selection 👌"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"not simple not intitutive"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Actually pretty handy. I personally use it to stay on top of things related to college, and it makes remembering deadlines a breeze. Creating and checking off tasks is such a cakewalk, and I actually feel a burst of motivation whenever I mark one for completion, urging me to tackle the next. Of course, you can use this for things besides study, such as daily chores and events, but that's just my example. Also works great with Google Assistant, so you can slap stuff on your to-do list on the go."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helpful, an ADHD must!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Useful tool to keep track of tasks and goals."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Please helps security sitting securely updated Knox device updates"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"it doesn't refresh like the desktop version"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Used to have a great widget with all the tasks. It has not been removed. The app has become useless to me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"very user friendly, neat and organized."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Need some color and animations in UI"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent functionality and easy to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"very useful and works well. new versions would ideally allow to add pictures to tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It's a shame that the app is gradually losing features. Can't create recurring tasks any more. Otherwise, I'd say the app is pretty good!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"really simple way to keep yourself organised better manner and also convenient because of not even a single advertisement"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Feedback"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"amazing! helps with school, family, everything!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ok good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"But I am not sure about it sorry 😐"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"This is a good app in terms of functionality but it could be a bit more user friendly and stylish"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's a good app. Smooth, gets the fairly simple job done but it needs better widget options and more customisation of how those widgets look."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Never installed this app please uninstall"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple y efectiva."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent tool."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Can't share lists with someone else. Whilst I can create a list of tasks, other tasks management tools such as Microsoft to-do enables shareable lists. It's not beyond googles capabilities to manage a shareabme list, their other products enable collaboration within a Google doc, so why not lists."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The widget stops working randomly. By that, I mean it stops updating and showing the current correct list of tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"beautiful app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"👍👍👍👍👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"can't seem to find a search function in google tasks app. Please help. works on desktop of Chrome but not app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Doesn't let me search tasks. Doesn't incorporate with Apple Reminders. Doesn't suggest dates and info based on what I type into the reminder (""walk dog tomorrow"" doesn't suggest ""walk dog"" on 12/34/56). Doesn't allow for swiping to delete or put off reminders. Other than that, it is basically ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good service for reminding."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Considering the amount of features that other task management apps possess, this is very underwhelming. The integration with google services (voice, ai, workspace) has so much potential, a pity that Google is not doing enough"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Me encanta. Aunque sería mejor que tuviera su propia configuración de tono y notificaciones, ya que en el teléfono no uso sonido normalmente, y al ser independiente podría configurarlo mejor. De ahí en fuera es súper sencillo colocar mis tareas, mis pendientes y mis listas de cosas que hacer o comprar, te brinda una mejor organización."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"sensational app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like the simplicity but it would be nice if users can have the ability to change the order of each task as they please"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"not very feature rich. id expect more from a Google app."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"আমি তোর পোলা এত বড় কাম করছি ভাই সব আমার দোষ"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So far, so good, with this app 😁 It will suit a lot of people because of its ease of use and useful functions."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Easy to use with nice options & results."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"This app is easy to use and awesome, but please add a unified ""Upcoming Tasks"" view to Google Tasks, showing all tasks with due dates across lists, categorized (e.g., Today, Tomorrow, This Week). Currently, I must check each list individually to track scheduled tasks, which is inefficient for planning."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"you should give the option of image Upload. and also can change the Notification sound."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"amazing. helps me be productive"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Useful but lacking one important feature."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"works well, no complaints"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Although I think they set up for tasks could be a little different, I do really like this and have found it useful. it's better than adding a bunch of tasks to my calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good app 💯"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Clean and integrated, but could use other colab features similar to other Google products- like adding collaborator, auto delete once done, background colors when adding to calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Thank you team who created this much useful app which is very very useful Very Good to use and very usefull , just can be better by 1- colour changing option 2-underline option 3- done itmes should be strikedout and remain in list 4-task numbering 5- option of sharing particular list 6- and assigning task to other person who is using Google T"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use thanks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Mum"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to view and organize your upcoming events/tasks.. this app makes everything easy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Pleasepppp"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"First test after coming from non-Google gtasks and ticktick. Widget would benefit from more compact presentation. (Just the reminder text, right now it can only fit 3 tasks quite wastefully). A ""slumber 15 mins"" is also great if you are busy but still just cannot forget this reminder short term."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"streamlined my task list by feeding it straight into my calendar. use the widget for extra efficiency"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app to track simple tasks and lists."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Super easy to have to do lists and the like. I am the lazy brain type (don't think it is my job to remember every little detail) so tools like this are magical for me. sub tasks are great as well (can order the chaos when required)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Update nahi ho raha hai ye"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Could do with more features but gets the job done"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"• Acceptable U.I. = +1★ • Notification Integration = +1★ • Easily Switch Between Accounts = +1★ • Missing Quality of Life Features (can't change default list, lacking sub-tasks for tracking step-by-step progress of more complex endeavors, etc.) = −2★ If Google adds those QoL Features, I'll update my rating accordingly."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Loving it!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Simple as repeating a task in less than a day is not possible."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent Aapp"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Really amazing sure u will like this app try it once .."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"need for more features"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps me to keep my life organized"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Some complain about limitations in Google Tasks, but I find that to be a feature, not a bug. Google Tasks is free, more reliable than most other task managers I've tried, and it's great for people who appreciate an app that doesn't take more time setting up and maintaining than getting stuff done."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Strike out tasks and subtasks after completion features is needed. Disappearing tasks after completed is frustrating."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I use it every single day nothing more need to be said. 🔥"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Requirement: If there can be timestamps or log like when have I created a particular task and when did I mark it as complete will help a lot."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"not getting notifications so what's the point. will try resetting"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"dikhai nahi deta he task mujhe notification nahi mila or naahi koi tone bajti he"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like Google Tasks !"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's organised me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this app is very helpful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This app is so good I always use this beside other good Google's apps, please make it possible to determine the percentage of progress of a task by showing graphic bar chart, and why the subtasks are shown separately in list, and why after completing all of them, the main task is still remained!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"عالی"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"worked great for a while, but now the widget is stuck permanently loading and not showing me my tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works great so far..... we will see"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and intuitive"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"useful apps working as expected"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love it! Does what it was designed to do and does it well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"simple, easy to use. would prefer to combine it in either keep or calendar apps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"more feature such as description, owners, date and ..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"just update most of reminders in a single task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Links with calendar and notifications. I can also link with Web pages."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The wonders of trying to figure this out have been challenging and exciting I am so thankful for this opportunity.I never thought this was gonna be possible to finally actually achieve ."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Good app, other than the fact that whenever I connect to wifi the app always starts to download 500 random things. I can't even figure out what's in the downloads either, all it says in the notifications menu is ""Google Tasks Downloading."" The app is already downloaded, and there's no updates."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to navigate"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"love this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"user friendly and very supportive in following up on assigned tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this app is really handy when it comes to setting reminders and transcribing tasks that you need to do throughout the day, I also like that it works really well with my pixel watch and Google Assistant, I have 80d and being able to take reminders down as they pop into my brain helps keep me grounded"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"motivations are not so great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Old app was better. Upgraded my phone to pixel 9 and gtask was updated also. No longer option to search task list or to see the completed list. Please add search option so we can find and edit tasks easily. Thank you!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this, so handy, better than a calendar or diary"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"they don't always go off"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app, easy to add to and mark off. Very helpful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app is inadequate compared to other platforms like TickTick and ToodleDo. It needs many more features to make it a viable to switch over: - ability to see one master list instead of having to mark every task item as a 'favourite' - ability to import and export tasks in - ability to create nested lists - ability to create nested or multi-item tasks - ability to colour code or label lists - ability to condense views and see lists more compactly - plus way more!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple, but has more functionality if you go looking for it. Does what I need, integrates with most things, and has widget options. Works for GTD."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great 👍 the"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very simple and professional"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"when typing in two different languages , the text is not organized (english-arabic)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy to use !!"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"no alarm system"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very good user interface i just with there was a way to move tasks between lists for efficiency"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Others Job Konsi bhi job chalegi ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's handy and integrated"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great tool for tasks!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"the main issue so far is that there aren't many options for setting reminder alerts, such as location-based alerts."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"When is the pixel watch app coming? Seems like every other tasks app figures this part out but not google. Any ideas?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I wanted a note with pictures"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"doesn't make a notification sound which is annoying"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It really a nice and useful aap . Helps to maintain work properly . Thanks Google ."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Lacks the ability to have a reminder go off based on location. Also if I click a notification from a google account that is not the one currently signed in, it doesn't pull up the task. Task notifications should also persist after device restart. And let me order my starred tasks please!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Overall good, but relatively simple. Some useful features would be deadlines for deadlines for tasks, and just like calendar events, there should be start and end time and multiple reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"axillant"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"одлично"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I enjoy the function of the app. I don't like that I can't view privacy settings. For example: Can others see my Tasks?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Repeat-Not Appearing Always, What particular button should press so can see Repeat icon, if Repeat not done early stages Once Set Time Done & Repeat not done, then after that in 2nd attempt Repeat Feature not appearing, so Totally Repeat Feature not able to use, as because Repeat Feature in Vanish, not appearing 2nd time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app for planning"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I find it very handy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this app a lot"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it helps me organize my plan and it's very helpful for me coz sometimes I forgot what I need to do"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"lol my tasks just disappeared which is so stupid, i heavily relied on this app, not anymore"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"==Features Suggestions. 1) I like Starred list. May I suggest another default list - Today , automatically shows all due today tasks into one summary list. 2) Task Search function == Bugs - when I create a task with subtasks, those subtasks are also been created under No Date on the list. This make user feel confused. And when the subtask is completed, it showed under completed as individual task which also created confusion which main task this subtask belong to."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Cool"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Useful gifts for all always leaning xx"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice terbantu buat reminder kegiatan daily"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"decent. simple. interface could be improved. proly wouldn't pay for it. like ability to make subtasks and mark them completed. had it almost a year and use it weekly. might use it more if the ui was streamlined"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Google Calendar was far better than this disappointment. I can't search for task or see them in a monthly view. Having yo vertically scroll through tasks gets annoying."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helpfully"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"All things bring good, missed the key feature that Google is good at - Search No option to search the tasks! Option to aset task duration is also missing!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I think it would be great if Google Tasks could sort notifications based on the priorities you set; thanks to Google Translate in Gboard😉 سپاسگزارم🙏🏽"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very productive"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"free and easy app I love 💗"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Hope you add a search button for it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Should be improved in notification section"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"punctilious app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's convenient to plan whatever you want ☺️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is a great app! Helps me a lot. organizing it is a bit painful but still good, I'd say."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Only wish there was a way to change the widget to dark mode individually without doing it through the android system settings."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love how it is accessible and simple and how it is integrated to the calendar app. I just wish they add some few features in the subtask so that it can have option to be repeated in specific days and weeks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"a splendid app, love how it syncs with my calendar seamlessly, and it's feature-rich! Easily a fave-star experience ★★★★★"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"👍🏻"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"20/10 app I struggle so hard to remember and today is the day I don't even need to try to this app is amazing and I can't believe that it can connect to my Google assistant and I love that I can sort my tasks in different sections this helped me out so much and changed my life I really recommend you get it if you don't have it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Can't live without this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like how simple it is, and that it integrates into Google Calendar!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Brilliant"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"everything goes good with task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"My go-to for managing multiple to-do lists on Android and Chrome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"wow"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for staying on top of tasks. I like the starred tasks that makes priority tasks easier to find."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The app is complete garbage. The entire draw of Google products is their ability to work together with ease. This app can't even function on its own. There are NO intuitive features. You can't share task lists through this app at all. You can't even copy and paste your list into a more functional app once you realize this one is trash. Uninstall with prejudice. The developers should feel bad because this app is BAD."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"cool"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best app ever and it's easy to use,anytime,anywhere and it's for everyone to enjoy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"See how it helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"please add timer"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Unloved by Google. Where's the collaborative editing and sharing? Where's the API? Many competitors stomp Google Tasks merely because Google doesn't try."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"If you want to have a personal assistant, then here you go. Great at keeping me on track."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Please don't ever get rid of this, I love how simple it is 😭♥️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Key points should be exchanged!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"This app is just okay. It's too easy to dismiss stuff and forget about it. You only get a quick little reminder at the top of the page. there is not really much else to it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I like Tasks but it drives me crazy that Google's own to-do app STILL doesn't follow a material theme. WTH?! My Task list is such an eye sore on my home screen. Also, why isn't there a Today widget? Such simple things... why aren't they fixed?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good but not great."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app, I just hate how any task with a a time is automatically added to my Google calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app has always fallen short, but now its even worse. There are so many things that could be done with a task app. Google has spent a lot of time integrating it with their Gmail and calendar, however simple things like having sub tasks that actually work have been taken away. It used to be almost impossible to print, they fixed that but now they've taken away the sub tasks in this app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it helps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"OK."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"does what I need it to do. the best task manager tool"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helps keep me on task & on schedule"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"tasks used to have a list icon in the bottom left hand corner, that when you tapped it, it brought up all of your lists so you could quickly pick the one you wanted to go to. I miss that; it disappeared with a recent update. other than that, awesome Todo list app, with great integration with Gmail and GCalendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"My favorite app for keeping my employees up to date and on schedule."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love how simple it is. As for its features, it's a part of your Google workspace, of course it's nice."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great. Just wish I could easily assign tasks to others in my household."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Everything is good , exept the feature to search between my list of todos, pls add those."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"handles tasks and subtasks well, but no delegation of tasks. and history of completed tasks is not sophisticated; no telling when something was completed. also, no delegation of tasks to other people."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So far it works best for my daily tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I want tasks to ""ring"" loudly, but I cannot get it to. Soo, NIX the tasks on Android! too bad, Soo sad for me..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I found this App to be the best of its kind and suits me perfectly! The best part is if you need to reload or do a factory reset on your device you don't have to retype the whole list again because it's saved on the cloud and will reappear once you log back into your account!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good tool for todos. Wish I would use it more often so it would actually help me with my overload. :)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"No due dates, no responsible person to be selected"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I don't get the notifications for tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's a good task app. Although Google might disappear it any day. Use it till you find a better independent app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app. works awesome."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Location remainder hona chahiye,our bhi tatah ke future"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Ux could be better: to enter into task list, I need to enter in the individual task and go back.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app. I use it regularly to ensure I don't forget anything."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Gets the job done in a non-BS manner. Love it!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome 👍🏻"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I never seem to get reminders when I set them"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"alarm sound and stickyness needed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"the most useful tool I can talk to"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Alerts/reminders don't always alert, and I depend on these for work and personal life. I just had a scheduled alert not go off and it caused a major problem. Also, please bring back location based alerts."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great job"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good interface, but feels lacking in it's abilities. Making a copy of a list, or being able to add a favorited task easily seems like obvious features to have, and yet they're not here."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I can make tasks so I can remember what to do"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"super clean, uncluttered and really well integrated with calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"You ser a reminder for 16:00 and it will remind you at 19:18..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ah."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The Google Caledar app already contains the entirety of this one, just a tap away. Why does this even exist?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very easy app to set up and understand. You organize your thoughts into a simple/productive or detailed/productive day. everyday. there are other apps that have more bells and whistles. but the point of the app is to simply add your tasks for the day/ month/year and include notes and times if you want. I highly recommend this for those who are moderately busy from day to day; so you can keep multi-tasking and not worry about having a journal, sticky notes, pens etc. Very Reliable!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"There's no transparent option in widget option"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Useless app Doesn't even remind even though notification is on Reminders was the best please bring back reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I find Tasks the perfect way of remembering my to-do lists and keeping track of my life! The widgets make staying on top of things so easy ❤️. I heard a rumor that Google is killing the standalone app 😭 and only keeping it in Calendar. I'd love better Tasks/Calendar/Keep integration, but losing the widgets would be a disaster! Please Google, improve & integrate, don't remove features! 🙏 #Google #Tasks #Calendar #Keep #Widgets #Productivity"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Like most Google apps. My experience was just fine"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Nice application 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"brilliant 👌🏻😍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app, Real-time sync with Google workspace is the plus."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Best app to achieve daily tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google Tasks is good for increase productivity. It has over all good features but subtasks of a task must be in hierarchical format in sorting by date, tasks with subtasks should have repeat time option and should contain collaborative editing."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Sometimes, it just doesn't remind me when I ask it to"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This simple, cross-platform app helps me stay on top of routine ""to do"" chores. It's much easier to let my devices remind me when it's time to do something than to try & remember every chore, medication due or appointment/errand. Since it's a stand-alone app it's not encumbered with all the choices & settings required of a full calendar reminder process. And it pops up a little light/dot on all my Google Home devices to help make sure I don't miss a reminder."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"a great way to stay on top of my list!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"lacks events like color choice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great for setting out daily tasks, chores and setting aside the building blocks of life and work goals for easily getting everything in your life completed and organized the entire way through. Now part of Google Calendar, Tasks is even easier and more organized than ever before."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"useful with more features and a different focus than keep"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The ability to add photos/docs to a task works make it 5 star. Excellent for what it is though."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love that Tasks integrates into my calendar!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"works well and syncs across devices seamlessly,"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Really useful way to ensure you remember to do regular chores like taking daily medication, putting bins out, cancelling subscriptions."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps run my life"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it's ok, only 3 stars because i don't like Google and it is supposed to do awesome apps due to their budget"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Totally awesome!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Provides no notifications"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Extremely useful tasks management app. Very simple. My only request is that we create a Wear OS extension. I'd like to be able to view my tasks and mark them off from my Pixel Watch."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Needs more color"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Have options optionsout now we have choices"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Widgets and calendar integration mean I seldom forget what to do or what to buy."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Needs a way to search through all the lists you have made"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Expanding"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"1) No option to manually sort tasks... 2) No option to sort by date in descending order 3) Once reminder added .. then can not change the list for that task even after removing remainder 😐😐 4) No option to share/mention others in individual task or list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very simple and productive for task completion."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"keeps me organized"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I don't like this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"task Reminder apl On Google Daily And routine Marking Activity For workingspace"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"decent to-do list app but lacks the ability to search for tasks or easily set routines"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Amazing app but there is room for improvement or i do not know how to work around this. If a task is repetitive within a day, say 3 times a day or 7 times a day, there is no option for the reminder to prompt 7 times a day for the same task unless the task is created 7 times individually for different times on the same day."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"What a PoS app...They forced us to download this steaming pile when they canceled tasks in calendar, but this is less functional by far. Why do I only see 30 days ?! We used to see much further, but that worked to well, and Gurgle had to F it up as usual. Gurgle chokes again..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"3 starts because of how basic these tasks functions are. However, Google Assistant goes back and forth from adding tasks to the Task App,Google Keep and Reminders. Worst of all, When using Google Assistant to add a Task you MUST include a due date, which there should be an option to not add a reminder time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"make a version for the watch too. the tasks from the calendar are not that great. need access to all my tasks and lists on the watch. it's good that apple watch has an app but wear os doesn't"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"from you get the understanding of the app, it makes life easier."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"December"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"no AI features, bad widgets, no alarms or reminder features, not that good integration with ""at a glance"" for pixel devices"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and effective. Integrates with Google Calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Needs to be a ALARM reminder."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I love the Subtask feature: being able to set alarms for subtaks would warrant 5 stars."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this app! It's a great place to jot down all of the business you need to handle."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Amazing tasking app. Nothing to complain. One feedback I want to add, I'd love to see a search feature. I could do that on PC but not in the app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple and convenient"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I want a custom assignment tone for every task"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it is what you put into it."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"works for me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it just works"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Not bad so far. But sometimes, it doesn't show the reminder on time unless one opens the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It doesn't allow delegating/sharing tasks with the contacts. Enabling this feature will significantly enhance collaboration capability of this tool. What's the fun if the collaboration is missing?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and Reliable."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great Idea !"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very convincing and simple design"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helpful things to remember"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google Tasks has been amazingly helpful and effective for me! The app is simple, neat, and contains all of the essentials. Tasks is also deeply integrated with the rest of Google Workspace, making it even more useful. If I could make one suggestion, it would be that there should be an ability to link recurring tasks to Google Sheets for the sake of keeping track of how often the tasks are actually completed in the long term. Great app. Thanks for reading!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great organiser, I love using it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great task organiser"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Would like to see app for WearOS, like google keep. Also maybe colors for category."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great tool for organizing my life"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I set tasks for a reason to remind me to come back to a specific activity at that particular time. This app is not thorough with reminding me of tasks that I set. It's a little frustrating because it is not 100% accurate with reminders' tasks set for a particular time frame. I noticed it has gotten worse over time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"last couple of month i have shared my problem several time but google not taking seriously. so i should leave from this google task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome and to the point. Would be even greater if the tasks can take multiple colors in the calendar"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Works well. I wish there was an option to snooze the task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Prefer Google notes. This is a little too basic with a poor organization layout that makes it difficult to see your old lists without scrolling. No color coding, etc."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Graet"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Works nice but it needs a priority setting add order numbers"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Never reminds me of anything. I only got this because ""Reminders"" wasn't on my phone anymore. It will remind me on my tablet, where it isn't installed and a device hardly use it for anything outside of reading e-books. But it won't work on my phone, where it is installed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I'd like to be able to invite another person to a task, so if it is completed by the other person, it shows as completed on my tasks list. It would be good to have the location box feature as well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love this app. I wouldn't be as organized and prepared if it weren't for this app!"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"My daily go too app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Hard"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"More than meets the eye. Easy to make tasks. Direct integration with Google calendar, and easy to move tasks between lists and create subtasks. Big issue for me is the lack of search. It's a basic function that you'd expect this to have and it's nowhere to be seen."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like this because it helps me keep track of my bills and helps organize my finances."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Useful but it can be improved"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very basic but very useful. a few extra features would be welcome. Love the integration with Google calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So far seems pretty straightforward to get all basics done, and daily or on the fly checklist is easy to set up."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"if there's analytics to measure monthly/weekly accomplishments it would be GREAT"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I believe there is a bug, that doesn't allow us to repeat a task with subtasks, also when the task is restored it's corresponding tasks are not restored simultaneously. Aside from that this apps work like a charm , and does as well as a Tasks app shd do with all its basic functionalities"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"integration needed with calandar and gemini and other Google apps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"category by date is missing in my vivo y20 phone, which is working in Samsung."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please give more attention to this app, its a good app but way improvable. Take notes from Microsoft To Do or Todoist, even Samsung Reminder. I just want a Google app better for Pixel users"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The notifications don't always show up. Inconsistent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"task made easy for reminder"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I'm enjoying keeping everything in order. I only wish I could change the task colors for calendar purposes, just like events. Each list could have its own unique color so when it's viewed on calendar I can quickly know which list it's from. Just a thought."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"🫂✨"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it's good for manage tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I think that the tasks app is so useful because when you wake up in the morning you already have a to-do list or like when your at the grocery store you already have shopping list so i think the app is amzing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"unreliable reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"just works and unlike many other apps doesn't charge you subscription fee."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good at what it does. Great for simple routine reminders and can coordinate into calendar if you wish. Very slick on daily reminders etc. and will clear them off at day end so you don't get them hanging over to the next day (assuming that works for you!) It's not a criticism but it's simply less good for more complicated project type action lists, sub actions, tabs, multi dates etc. For all those you need apps like todoist or tick tick (and other such like)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it works. nothing special. no problems."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Really enjoy the simplicity and straightforwardness. Also enjoy the widget"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I would like to see some connection from a task to events in Google calendar, since that is what I do everyday, I just copy the task name to a new event each time. Also, it would be great to see some kind of archive for tasks with a faraway due date, so they won't clutter the list with tasks that are not relevant for now."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"one of the tools I use daily on my Pixel"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Thanks for the clothes you give up for me I like hung because me I need money"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Does 1 thing well. Quick to add and check off tasks. If you need more than check out Google Keep. Integration with ecosystem could be better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Excuse my ignorance, perhaps, but is it possible to search for a task by name?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"recommended nice app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"liking it so far"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Tasks is simple, intuitive, customizable and integrates well with Calendar. I only wish it'd allow me to search through my trove of completed tasks. Then I could restore and reuse them instead of recreating them from scratch."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"perfect"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"fine. can't subnest, can't share, can't edit fonts colors easy, no ai"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This app works well enough. I wish the task list could be more dense and I could list undated tasks next to overdue tasks."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"非常有用的工具，可以设置好各种定期任务"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ability to turn an email into a task is absolute brilliance. This has literally changed my life. Now if only google would open the API to allow WhatsApp , signal and messenger to integrate with tasks, I would never forget anything ever again."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app for reminder of tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"always helping me to stay on top of bills and tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great Tasks App - Just needs snooze/reschedule function."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"My favorite app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful. love the feature to delete completed tasks. better than MS To-Do"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"App is good... But I am not able to add sub topic when I do loop... If I use sub topic I am not able to use loop... Please fix this in a update"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"tasks is such a handy part of the calendar. notifications stay until I mark them complete so I don't forget but they don't clutter up an already full calendar!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Tasks does not show notifications frequently, and they won't show back up if you restart your phone."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Needs a better notification system. it's very easy to dismiss the reminders as a spam notification."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great mobile tool for quick tasks that integrate with Google Calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"adapable, works well across devices, integrates with calendar, let's you link docs though drive."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best Task list out there. You can arrange and change anything."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple good integration with calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Why don't you introduce Search Box in Task Application? In my previous feedback and recommentation I have mentioned this. But all went un noticed. Often Searching tasks and reminders are required in day to day routine. Referring to the Past Tasks is a very common requirement. Introducing search bar in Task Application will be a great help to users."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice, and organized"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Despite notifications being turned on, it's not sending me notifications and I'm missing tasks! It's also stopped my calendar app from notifying me! Am I doing something wrong?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"the widgets help keep track of my errands"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's a useful app and I am able to get the type of functionality that I want."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great App. It'll be perfect if I can collaborate with others to manage tasks by allowing access to others to see my tasks, assign tasks, and have discussions"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's really good service"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is very handy and easy to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I love that it's integrated with the calendar and how easy it is to use and create categories too!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Desperately needs natural language processing!!! Love the VERY clean UI!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"great overall. I wish I was able to customize the look and feel of specific task lists like Keep. I also wish there were better grouping options."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Great for planning, shopping lists, etc."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"My tasks never stay in the order I put them in. I keep track of bills and due dates this way. I constantly have to rearrange them."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Gets the right priority list, every time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"🙂 Pretty simple to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It works well as a to-do list, but for some reason pop up alarms aren't working."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this helps me keep things in mind not only in my personal life but professionally as well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"amazing app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I use with Google Assistant and they add stuff to my list as reminders. I love that I can do that. I wish there was a way to have the task reminder be read loud by GA. I often miss the reminders because they're buried in my drop down menu."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not getting any notifications. This app is terrible compared to the way it was before"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Google Tasks offers a clean, intuitive interface with excellent Google service integration, making it easy to manage tasks across Gmail and Calendar. While perfect for basic task management, the app's notification system needs improvement - tasks are easy to miss with only notification bar alerts, and the lack of custom alert sounds limits user customization."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"reminders are broken when used with Google assistant. either it doesn't set the time or sets it wrong. it shows the correct time in the acknowledgement when spoken to, but the app will later show a different time. This is a big screw-up"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Give me the option to put reminders in my calendar again..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Alphabetical sort please........"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Use it daily across several devices. Love the flexibility, one wish for the developers is to add a simple search function."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good basic task app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very nice app, the only limitations I noticed is if I have a lot of tasks daily (like 5-7) it will show up on the calender only for 2 months, maybe 3."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"great app. seamless use cross platform. would like to see stand alone on PC. otherwise no comment"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"notifications do not appear"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Super awesome and happy ending good weekend 😊"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"nice 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Everything is good just add feature to repeat for every 1 hour or 30 minutes"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent To Do app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"not user friendly. keeps on crashing."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"You'd be surprised how barebones and missing simple, intuitive functions an app is from a company as big as Google. Can't make tasks repeat by hour. Can't move a repeating task in another list. Can't, for some reason, delete the time and date in a task so you can move it. Once you've set a time and date, make sure it's in the correct list- or you'll do it all over again! Disappointed at the lack of simple functions."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Tasks is relatively new to me but I am finding that I am relying on it more each day. I still have my Google Keep and Calendar apps. I like how tasks displays down the sidebar of Calendar on my laptop, but as an app icon on my phone. I'm curious if it has always looked this way and I somehow didn't notice."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I heard it would have pops up when you're trying to use the app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works , so sadly soon it will be discontinued 😔"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Practical list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It's great and all but the apple version allows easily to switch between the headings when tapped and in android you have to scroll and find if you have alot of headings. I'd prefer if the andriod version had the same thing that in the main menu where all the headings are, you can toggle between the headings and choose and directly land on them like apple rather than sliding the headings and then choosing them in android. It's better in iOS if ii must say and if that happens here it'd be better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app use to be great and was my to go app for reminding me of appointments and what not but after the Gemini update it ruined it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I think this is useful. In conjunction with Home and telling my AI or hub what's what, I now use this for all my planning and scheduling requirements. Very simple, straightforward application."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great but i wish they would allow us to give our opinions about some features we want"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps me a lot🙌 Makes my work a lot easier!! Recommend it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Used to be Better - as usual, Google took a good product and made it worse. I'm sure at some point they will drop it, create a new product that does the same thing with an ambiguous name and re-add all the features that make it like the original. It still lacks the ability to share lists with other users and they've removed the quick access button so now you have to scroll through all your lists to find the one you want instead of going directly to it like you used to be able to."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A truly helpful and easy to use app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps me remember tasks that I forget. I often stop what I'm doing to jot down a task, and quickly check my task list when there's a break. Marking tasks as completed is a nice little dopamine hit too."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"loved and got amazed by the service keep it up!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Mkbhd sent me to this app and I must say I love it! Great way to navigate all tasks, personal and professional alike. I love that I can create separate lists to neatly categorise all things I should take care of. I used google keep and google sheets for that before - I'm not going back!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I really like it 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great task manager, only wish I could set the daily reminder time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"pretty nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it just does what you need it to do good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Usefull"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google tasks is superb for keeping track of appointments and stuff that you need to do. I especially like the fact that I can create extremely lengthy notes about a complicated task by completing the ""add details"" section."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"has stopped giving me my reminders despite notifications being on + do not disturb being off"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Gets the job done (no pun intended) but the widget and app are very basic and lack any customisation."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please add habits tracking option"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please add an ""All Tasks"" tab that contains all of the tasks from all of the custom lists. It's killing my adhd. And a full screen widget. And let tasks live on multiple lists. Ty!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Terrific....😊💕"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"life changing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good & simple"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Pleae add the feature Task to repeat there are currently 3 options 1. Never, 2. On, 3. After Add 4th option as 'Marked as Complete'. So Task will repeat until the user mark it as complete ✅ Rest all is good"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"After playing with it for a few years, now finding useful for projects and lists."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Watch support needs to be added"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"needs to add a feature to search the to do list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best messaging app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app. Would love if the Eisenhower matrix was added to it. Would make it perfect."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"After 2002 again I reconnected to the same fields back which one dropped. 2001 When I entered the wandering world about technology. So many efforts are there lack of education shortage of instruments costly interest service providers to become independent.

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Got reminder for a 11:30am task at 4:38pm. What's even the use of this app then?,"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I like it. But it would add to the usefulness if i could have a widget in my home screen. Where we could easily make a list without having to enter the app all the time. Currently, the widgets are not even updating"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"hey google the app is perfect but please add review of work done by me in weeks every week"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"A good app but please, can you make me delete my completed tasks? I have tried to delete them a million times but it doesn't when I refresh."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app but microsft to do is better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it's free. no ads. simple to use. however it seems poorly designed either to support productivity or to leave yourself reminders. hard to tell how to best use it. unclear how it can be integrated"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Birenderkumar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This app is brilliant. I can manage not just my own tasks, but I can manage tasks for my wife and vice versa and manage or allocate tasks for my son for jobs around the house. However, the tasks only pop-up in the notification bar on the lock screen and home screen when I swipe down on my Samsung. Could there be further development for a whole screen notification that grabs the attention of the user? Something that has to be acknowledged by the user for the screen to clear."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The notification options switched. This is awful for usability."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"App has lot of bugs. Don't even know if it requires network connection to work. App always bring notification of a task a a wrong time especially soem days after I schedule it to notify me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Super helpful and being able to use my Google assistant to set specific times and days for things is a game changer !!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"please add options to make subtasks, my executive function is gone"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So easy and helpful!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"needs a feature where tasks reset their time after compleing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I would give it 5 stars because it works really well. But i think there is still a place for improvement. I wish there were some options that one person could enable/disable for added functionality. Like being able to : (1) collapse sub tasks (2) add a confirmation when you clear a main task without checking the sub tasks. (3) being able to add subtasks to subtasks, like a third and fourth layers of subtasks (4) one user could even remove some functions they might not need about the core app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"literally the best"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good aap but sound update and change repeat option"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No alarm"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"its really useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Just like ms todo app, it would be greater if It had a option to stick to notification shade until the task is marked complete or rescheduled. As of now the notification shade appears with tasks and would be cleared with other notification on click of clear."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Hey Google team, I really like this app cause it's so simple yet effective. I had a different task app earlier but it was so difficult to get around and had too many features. I couldn't set a simple task minus having to spend so much time & mental energy yet that's the very thing I was hoping to have to eliminate 😂 Though, here's the catch, I'd appreciate if you could include a feature that allows us to set the duration for a task. That's the only problem this app has. Thanks Google team"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Currently using this aap and I am satisfied with its working.I just want to say one thing that you should work on its reminder option."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"A good start, it works as expected. I gave it 3* due to lacking features, useability and general lack of polish"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Mejorar la versión de escritorio para dispositivos Windows sería una opción que plantearía a los usuarios mantenerse en Google tasks, ya que al tener tu tarea en varios dispositivos, y con la facilidad que implica crear tareas con atajos de teclado y gestionarlas sin necesidad de abrir el teléfono. A veces la pestaña en el calendario no es tan útil, pero un apartado dedicado especialmente a las tareas donde se ordene por prioridad resulta acertado para esta aplicación."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"good app, but wish it had more features, especially features for AI gemini integration. only reason I'm using this app over Todoist is because of its gemini integration. a lot of potential and hope it becomes more features rich: - voice reading of notifications as a default feature - alarm feature as an option for reminder. I want it to alarm so that I am forced to address the task reminder and not risk missing it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"There are more things you could do. One of them is programming tasks with times per week, like habits. Another one is checking them as completed or incomplete, for instance, if I didn't achieve the task one day."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome way to keep myself organized and on top of tasks and events to keep me ahead of the game!?!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"App is very good. List menu option was removed, it is very poor decision by Google. If you have to go last task it is very time consuming and uneasy. Request you to provide list option to directly select to task. Hope Google will get back the option soon. Give export option in Google Task, so user can easily access data in exported format such as Google doc and Google sheet. Thank you."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Notifications don't work on most of my tasks. About 2/3 of the time I set a task reminder for a specific time I do not get a notification. I've verified notifications are enabled for the app. Still a problem Dec 2024."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No option to jump to a specific date / year etc. A very BASIC feature is missing!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"could use a little UI touchup.Possibly add words on top of the symbols so you know what exactly they meant, only other touchup I would add is ability to completely delete them without having to go to finished tasks, maybe you can and I just haven't figured it out. I've been with Goog since they started, luckily invested then. Also can you send invites from tasks or what app do I need for that? What's 1 more app, I think I use every single one Google has produced so far. Great job Goog employees!"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Hi... google tasks have now been incorporated within google calendar recently, however when I want to add any email from my google mail to tasks it is asking me to install the google tasks stand alone app again...it does not take me to google tasks within the Google Calendar...this problem must be resolved before Google removes tasks stand alone app from play store. Hope this makes sense. In other words iam not able to add any gmail to tasks without the tasks app in my android mobile."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great tool!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Featureless. Zero settings. Another useless app from Google. Only option is to delete the whole list? Unbelievable this was released in this state. The FAQ in the play store page states it was created by AI and every answer given is a hallucination. I am the most up to date version and there is nothing like what is described... It says to complete a task by checking the far right which was never where a task was checked and now is a star option. GIVE A DELETE PRESS"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Fixed the issue with re-schedualing or moving tasks forward if missed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Not much you can really say about this app it's a great app can you tell it what to remind you of and set a time and it does just not good job"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good for keeping tract of tasks that need to keep track of."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Now that Tasks are being integrated (merged) into the Calendar app, the Task's need ""event color's"" because when viewing them on the calendar, they are just blue. I would really like to set the color for each Task list so that all of my financial/banking Task's are green for example."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love material you design 💖"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Its been great so far"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's amazing, but the sub-tasking system is very annoying. Every time I write a task and hit enter, it should enter the task and place me on a new line to enter a new task. I shouldn't tap on ""add tasks"" every time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good, but not great. I like how we can add new tasks without opening the app, but the widgets are awful. Very boring and no colour. We need to integrate calendar events as well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please add Checklist feature, it will be very useful.. Need snooze feature , when notification arrives. It will be useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's handy, however it would be better if the widget could be customized instead of black background with white writing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very good. Can't give it five because I can't see why it is missing two simple and very useful functionalities: 1. Search functionality: if you have plenty of tasks over several groups, it can be difficult to find something specific. You can bypass this by using calendar's search and then ask it to be sent back to Tasks. Odd. 2. Today's tasks. A simple page with filters on tasks scheduled for the day. Are you ever going to implement these low hanging fruits ?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"How to change first day of week?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This would be perfect if I could attach photos and files to a task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"where is mark as completed history please shown this also"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not collaborative. I need the function of sharing a list with someone. Apparently this feature is on the browser but why is it not available on the app?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"This app is very useful and fast. However, it needs more options, like labels, but not too many—just simple and effective ones."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Notifications dossaper random. Not ok. I am leaving the notifications as unread to not forget what I must do."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Looks good. I'm looking forward to seeing this app improve my life and schedules"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good night"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"subtask is showing as main task if sorted by - starred . if sorted by - my order ,it is displayed normally . please do testing ."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"How can I change the first day of the week?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't support shared synced lists anymore which is the main point of this type of app. It's pretty worthless because of that."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great for somebody like me who forgets , especially if you're busy with multiple tasks on an hourly and daily expected work life"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I use it daily. It's basically what my Google Assistant uses to set my reminders. It merges them with my Google calendar so I get notifications that I can repeat daily or recall later."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Update: as of 11/29/24, this still hasn't been resolved. The most recent update seemingly fixed it, but nope. Back to out-of-sync tasks. I use tasks every day. It's excellent, when it works. Recently, the widget has been so buggy that it makes me not want to use tasks at all. It doesn't stay updated, and the only way to get it synced again is either to restart my phone or remove the widget and put it back on my screen, both of which are less than desirable solutions."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"After update no notifications for reminders/ task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Total trash. Reminders was infinitely better. How so? Let me count the ways: 1: Pending/Overdue: if you marked an overdue reminder as Complete, Reminders would change the date to reflect when you completed it. Tasks does not. 2. Copy/Duplicate: Reminders could be copied to a different account or duplicated to a new date; Tasks can't do either. 3. Lists: You can't move tasks from one list to another. So all those reminders they imported to Tasks? Stuck as ""Default List"". How is this helpful????"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app is terrible. I like how easy it is to set a reminder, but even with notifications turned on most times you get no reminder at all."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Thans"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Google Tasks Developers, Can you please : 1. Add Search Option. 2. Move deleted tasks to bin instead of just disappear them. 3. Increase Limit of how much we we can write in tasks. 4. Add Fonts and Styles. 5. Add Refresh Button like google keep."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Amazing statistics 👌 love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Just lowsy in general. The way it dictates time, notifies you. How to access and get to it. I feel like this is another hat on a hat where Google has 5 apps that should all do this and be synced and yet this is the default one Gemini uses when you say set a reminder... Put it on my calendar, put it in keep.. why are there new not as good apps doing things the other apps already do... It's just pointless."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's great for reminding me of little things I need to do throughout the day. I also love the widget available on my phone to make adding to and checking my task list throughout the day"

People are using other apps like ticktick, todoist majorly because the tasks and events are same in them. That way we can check off events too. And have start and end times for tasks. Etc etc etc Just merge them into one thing. Please. I'm eagerly waiting for it. Thanks!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Its great, its easy, and so simple. I just have one feedback: can you implement Eisenhower metrics and Pomodoro features? That would be really interesting,and would really help concentrate on task at hand."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"works well, needs a few tweaks, but overall is easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app overall. Slightly limited controls over list behavior.

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy an clear to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent format! Simple to navigate and put things into priorities. At first, I thought that I wouldn't find this app useful because I could just set my alarm, which is easier. But, I can expand my notes and have everything in one screen. To whomever created this masterpiece, deserves a raise and a huge pat on the back."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Need some more functionality. At least TODAY section."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Add habit tracker options"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice apl"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Love this app but 4 requests please. (1) allow me the option to delete only current instance of recurring tasks rather (2) allow me to manual move the order of tasks when sorting by date and not only when sorted by order. (3) also round the corners of this app's widget in the same way that Google keep's widget is rounded in the corners. (4) Please allow different colour notifications for different task lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it works"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"NOT Working"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"All"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Why I can only set recurring daily task up to one month? I have chosen no end anyhow but still not working!"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice job"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Edit: Complete junk app. Didn't get a single notification for 3 reminders I had for today. Samsung hasn't failed me one. Switching back. Why in the world did I think I'd be a good idea to switch to this?!? Why are Google products so trash?!? Samsung also has the feature I want below. It works. But please create an option to create tasks/reminders that repeat every hour (or few hours). Currently the app only allows repeat for day/week/month/year."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I like the app. I just wish there was a way to one task, but with how many times a day per week. Like twice a day every day. Or twice a day every other day for example"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this App it is excellent!"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Kindly Add: 1. Search function 2. Trash/Bin 3. Multiple select tasks 4. AI organize based on the time & past history"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"why don't you merge App "" google Keep"" & "" google task "" ... even google assistance doesn't recognize the ""google task "" even after specifying ""Google Task"" in Input."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"does the bare minimum, but the google calendar integration makes it fine / my task app of choice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Was great until recent update when they took away the useful widget. I liked having access to the to do list Google assistant creates for me. Of course Google kills useful functions for no known reason again."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's cool but I would have loved if I could share my tasks with someone"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"VERY HELPFUL APPLICATION FOR STUDENTS AND ANY OTHERS."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"What exactly can this app do that requires a complete new app that Keep 
cannot do? I thought this would sync everything from calendar and keep and 
Gmail, but no."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works great so far"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Repeating tasks doesn't work at all! I've set up daily repeating tasks but it showing up only on the first day. I wan't to see repeatongs tasks on tomorrow, on the day after tomorrow etc to have clear information about my schedule"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The best app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"more view options, eg. view for all tasks would be preferred, also it'd be better to change the theme or background of the tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good application's."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"it would be better if the upcoming task would have more of a alarm style notification like if it rings until you click on it"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this is an outstanding Google product."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Aplicativo bem útil e funcional. As vezes acontece um bug da opção abrir mais sobre a tarefa e não funcionar, mas reiniciando o aplicativo se resolve."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Helps keep up daily and non-daily tasks. Could improve by allowing the UX to be able to drag one task to another list. Rather than clicking on it and selecting which list to move it to. Reducing the needed steps."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Latest version is freezing up. I click a task and it won't open. Have to restart app to fix it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I find it excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"No search function greatly restricts usefulness"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Tasks as a reminder service has one basic function - that is to notify the user of tasks as they become due. Lately I've noticed that on occasion pop up reminders with sound notification don't come through but as soon as I open the app - hey presto up comes the notification. The annoying fact is the inconsistency, sometimes the notification comes through as a pop up with audible reminder, other times it doesn't. I have not restrictions set in the app so I don't understand why this is happening."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It is very useful and easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This is a nice simple app. No fancy bells and whistles. There are plenty of those. One problem. Why is there no Windows version? Is there going to be one so that my Task Lists range across ALL my devices?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Adding this functionality to Wear OS would significantly improve usability, allowing for easy tracking on the go. Moreover, incorporating color options for tasks would enhance the visual appeal of the calendar and make tasks more distinguishable, thus serving as a unique differentiating factor."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Dear Team, Tasks are disappearing after adding to Application list. Confirm resolution ASAP."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"👌"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please make task that not have date when using date order to appear in upper part of list and make widget spacing more compact"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Awesome. Only feature suggestion, give us the ability to add reminders days or minutes before like with Google Calendar and it's perfect."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"How do you not have search functionality on android mobile??????!! Aweful experience without it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I wish this app didn't prompt me for reviews"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"awful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Poor alternative to gtasks. No search!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Unreliable and buggy."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"GREAT TOOL"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice. Simple & easy to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It would be nice if I could search for specific words, like it is possible in some other task management and note-taking apps."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Task me to the money 💰💰💰"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good app. Very simple. Maybe that goes against it. You can't search for a specific task, so you must look between your starred and every single one of the zillion lists you may have created so you maybe have a chance. Also, you could develop the possibility to use it in an independent tab on web so it's not always in Gmail."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I enjoy this app; it helps me keep everything I need to do in one place and I can organize it into different groups. I would like to see a Schedule tab on here that I can organize the way I want and know what needs to get done. I don't assign times to a lot of my tasks but know what should get done before/after another, and would like to be able to organize that my way. The schedule tab would help me see what I have going on just today instead of all tasks. please consider adding this feature!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Improvement are required like sharing task with others"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Would be nice to have the ability to color code task lists, in a way that can transfer over to Calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple with all necessary features."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"GREAT app for keeping me organized and on ""task."" I do wish it had better sorting options. I don't always need to date & time a task, but I'd like to put them in a preferred order."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It is incredibly basic. You can make a checklist with due dayes. That's it. There are no actual notifications when tasks are due. Assistant used to have notifications, so this is not a proper replacement."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This NEEDS to be on Google Pixel Watch or Wear OS. So sad. People are talking. Pathetic Google."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good so far"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not intuitive. You're way better than this, Google."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Features missing, like you cannot set custom notification tones, you won't be reminded with full screen alerts like alarm , no watch app , going back to my samsung reminder , it could be much better with a detailed notification settings , hope Google team is listening If we drill down to notification settings in phone , there too notification categories un available"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This the best app for who person is willing to any thing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great simple task app. I just wish there was a wear os app. Also it would be nice to have recurring tasks down to the hour for medicinal use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Why can't you share your list of tasks or invite someone to contribute (add a collaborator)? Should have a search bar for when you have a huge list of tasks! Should be able to set an hourly reminder for example, if you have something to do four times per day like take tablets or something."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"😊❤️💛💚🧡👋🩵🩷🤓"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Only feature missing is the ability to set recurring reminders for missed tasks. Either at a given interval (every X hours) or daily at a set time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"This app was flagged for draining battery and suggested to be placed in deep sleep, please fix."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very practical! The only thing that's surprisingly missing is the possibility to sort the items alphabetically. Hope this option will be added soon."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice and the SIMPLEST application."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love that I found this. For someone like me it's a necessity. I am undiagnosed autistic with multiple other neurological disorders like memory and brain fog."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent 👌👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"First time using this app. I am still learning how to use this app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Good but I often lose notes that I write down if I forget to explicitly hit the save button. The note **should** just auto save but it doesn't and I end up losing a fair amount of notes. Also unnecessary padding got added to the notes list display which looks terrible! Fix these two things and I'll update this review. Thanks!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I am using it now more and more."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Works great, most of the time. But sometimes it fails to remind of tasks I've marked for a time period. For some reason, it shows the to-do task only after I open the app. This happens randomly."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Just Perfect for me to manage things"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"one of the best task app among all the app that I use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The app in multiple occasions has not given me my reminders and has let me down. Its unacceptable so I will look for a more reliable app."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"support for labels or tags and I'd rather it a 5. I share URLs, copied text, etc to deal with later. I love how you can create my own categories, move tasks between them, and lots more"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Recognised or not"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Almost perfect, but missing a basic feature. The fact that Google won't let you add subtasks to reoccurring tasks is a fundamental flaw. There is no reason for a tasks app to exist without this basic functionality."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"❌ I can't move a task from one List to another by dragging, please add this feature to the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Guys, this application must be part of notes."

If you (development team) think this may be irritating to the users, then give it as option ""Send Notifications till completed"". In most of the cases, notifying me about a task till I complete is the most desirable thing. Please look into this"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This app would be incredible if you could share task lists with someone. Unless you can do that and I don't know."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Notifications are completely borked! How useful is a tasks app if you never get notifications? Had to uninstall to get my calendar events/tasks notifications back. I checked every relevant notification setting and battery optimization and background setting. Only fix was to uninstall this app for good."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"تن"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Dude. It's not a software it's an app. You have to make it user friendly. You guys have to think like Steve jobs. 1. What's the purpose? 2. How easily can it do ? 3. Then comes accessibility and features. You guys pay the MBA guys, software developers, experts, marketing consultants, etc and forget the basic. Functionality matters dude. Make it simple make it clean. You have done good with Google docs, like that try to know the customer."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"super underrated app, I've tried a lot of these and I can bet my life that this is absolutely the best and that you'll love it. It's super simple to use and I love the division into ""topics"" and subtasks. I am convinced to give it 5 stars after I wrote to support about a small detail that I thought was missing for perfection, the widget, which they added it after two weeks. GREAT JOB GOOGLE TEAM!"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"In my personal opinion, the application icon should be well worked on and more options should be added within the application."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good app, but leaves a lot to be desired."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Keeps me organized and productive"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Works okay but needs to better isolate notifications from calendar and also develop a watch app. As a first party developer, Google apps should be the first ones to exist on all relevant Google ecosystem device types. It shouldn't be that there's so many top rated third party task apps with watch support and yet Google's own app doesn't operate on WearOS."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Been using this more and more but recently there's a bug where the white tooltip that appears whenever you do something, it doesn't disappear and instead blocks access to my keyboard or part of the screen, preventing you from typing or accessing certain parts of the app. The only fix is to force close it and reopen."

I have to say that I've had so many different hand calendars and books and binders and I always seem to fail at keeping them up pretty much. with this app I can say that so far I've got more and more interested in actually using it because I always have my phone. it actually helps me get things accomplished instead of going on social media.

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's experience is very good i will happy by its performance"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome. Could have had alarms that actually rang"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Nice app, thankyou! If we mark a task as completed accidentally, we can mark it back as uncompleted, but that task won't be shown in the notification bar again unless we change the time, fix it asap, once again thankyou."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Google Tasks is a very simple yet effective Task List. In my case I list all the jobs I will like to complete in a day and cross them off as they are done. Personally I would like some text formatting like colour and bold. However, it remains an easy to use and effective tool."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"""Google Tasks is a fantastic tool for keeping my mind organized! It syncs with Calendar and Gmail, making it easy to manage tasks, set reminders, and stay on track with my busy schedule. I hope Google keeps it free and always available—it's essential for staying productive. Highly recommended!"""

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Okay and Journal One much more advanced and feature rich"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Notifications just plain don't work. Ever since reminders moved to the Tasks app I haven't gotten a single notification on them. I have checked all the settings and have a Pixel 8 with latest Android. This is ridiculous."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The updated notifications with the rescheduled option is very poorly designed. Please remove the reschedule button or move it to the left."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Vgood"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Amazing , just need some small features and it will be the best, im amazed how fast syncing is..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"extremely useful and efficient program for organizing my life"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"ti is great that have connected to google calender"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"keeps history of completed tasks. what more could you ask for?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The built-in Google tasks allows to reschedule a task for a later time, which is very convenient. Installing this removes that functionality. Why would I want to use such an app?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good and easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It would be nice to have shared lists; this is the only feature that stops me from using it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I have tasks that I don't want to stop so I use the NEVER expire option in the setup, after 3 months it stops the task and I have to create a new task it's very annoying"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Almost completely non-customizable as far as user experience goes. It works well enough as a to-do list, but you can't make it your own. Honestly feels like an app that Google is trying to make feel like Apple; if I wanted an Apple feel I wouldn't have an Android."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"honestly, good enough"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"guys I wanted a good app to help with my produtiveness and this is the bes thing I have ever tried."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app is stunningly bad. The lack of options and inability to use it as a reminder for tasks, which is what it should be designed for, is unbelievable. I can't believe this product was designed by Google."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Like this app. Just wish it had a bit more options."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"sometimes done task suddenly delayed and appeared all at once."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"there should be a priority changing option when you sort your tasks by dates"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"working 💪 as I have been accomplishing goals as they have stated. organization is key to getting things done with effort less time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Doesn't explain anything to do with what I am looking for"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Please add a function in which I can move task one list to another list and add the option subtask for repeating tasks. Besides all other these functions, good."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good stuff ig what else am I supposed to say"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very minimalistic and easy to use. But can you please update the widget to have a tranparent or less opaque background. It would look really great if wallpaper is visible through it. Just a little aesthetic look."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"basic and easy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app for tasks. It helps keep me on track, especially during times when I'm juggling too much to remember them all. I hope Google further improves this app for even more efficiency and added features. Adding a file as an attachment can be helpful for certain tasks."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Inskeeps)). (). AB."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Exceptional app but with one major floor. Very uncluttered, very simple, works great on desktop version too. I have over 1400 completed task using this app. If you have a google home devices you can use this to remind you of a task and it logs it in this app instantly, that's the main reason why I stick with this app, no other. The 1 major floor is that you can't see future repeated tasks until the day the task is due, this is a real pain if you know you have a task due soon but you can't see it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The UI looks pretty modern but the navigation/controls quite archaic (Window 95) . For example, if I want to set-up a reminder for today for later time, I have to pass though all those tiny buttons piking up the day, time, am/pm, etc. This requires so much concentration. Worth noticing the one-hand experience that has room for improvement: what's the point of scattering buttons on different sides of the screen? Why not to place them in one place and let users choose where, right or left."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Dated look and interface, useful but looks like it was designed in the 1980s with no UI UX updates since then."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work properly, half my reminder notifications come up at random times a few hours later or the next day. But if i check in the app they are setup correctly... Typical of google to discontinue the perfectly working ""my reminders"" and create a new app that doesn't work properly"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good application's, this application is super helping for any Data carry service, thanks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Just installed , I enter app , touch add icon , touch clock icon , touch repeat , i use weeks but dont know what does every above the sqaure mean !!!"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I think it's very ugly what you guys did with the card within the tab. Waste of space as well as redundant repetition of tab title"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Number one missing feature: ""repeat x time after completion"". I don't want to change my furnace filter on the 3rd of every month, I want to change it 30 days after the last time I changed it. Number two: sharing a task list, like I can share pretty much every other Google thing like a spreadsheet or a keep list. That's.... Pretty much it. That's pretty much what has me using a different app and having to copy my Google tasks off to a different app every time I ask for a reminder"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"once you get used to it in your daily or corporate life it gets you everting done fast and in time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Notification tone not changing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app. I can keep track of task I want to do from all my devices"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's very good 👍"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app please keep the app simple"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it works great for what it's designed to do"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Add ""Alarm"" feature (with 52 weeks foresight), No, calendar apps aren't Bible enough. The Genesis of the thought eludes the garden-variety wage-earner with lofty ideals."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"great, but wish it was possible to meet an alarm"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Limited features. Weak web user interface"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I don't know where this came from and I don't know how to get it off my phone, so if you could, I would really appreciate it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This app is very light and very good and tasks are easy to create and customize. One thing that is missing is to pin tasks at top because even after labelling some tasks as important i.e star ⭐ symbol it still goes down the list and sometimes out of screen. Also there should be an option to search for tasks in the list of completed tasks for quick access."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please make a more clear separation of today's tasks from future tasks in each list. Please add an option to see your calendar within the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"please make version for PC (windows)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Unreliable - tasks doesn't repeat in intervals. Create tasks with biweekly, weekly, monthly intervals. Complete one occurrence, and then you do not see the next occurrence coming, it's simply marked as complete, I waited for next occurrence task for that particular week, and still don't see a new sequence notification ( the task from completed is still marked completed and no new sequence is created, though the task with on repeat)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"there are much more capable apps it's just a alarm app with title of alarms nothing more."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helps me get my ducks in a row"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"User friendly and syncing tasks across ecosystem is pretty good. But if app had some visual customisations it would have been better also there is no transperency adjustment for widget to all google widgets. This should be improved."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"مازال تحت التجرية"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I’ve been using Google Tasks for a while now and appreciate its simplicity. However, I’ve noticed a significant limitation – I’m unable to block more than 30 minutes per task. This restricts me from efficiently planning my day with longer tasks. It would be great if Google Tasks offered more flexibility with task durations. I hope the development team considers this feedback in future updates. Thank you"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"don't remind me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"To add a task for the year 2034, had to manually tap the arrow button through each month till desired date reached in year 2034. There was no option to type in the date manually."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I basically used tasks as an easier interface for my calendar. it's way easier to add a task then it is to add a calendar event. so now my calendar in conjunction with tasks act like a daily planner. which no one seems to make anymore."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is perfect for reminding me of my tasks. My suggestion in this application, make the date of creation of the ""task"""
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"lots of embeddings in other apps making it far more useful than other task lists. calendar, browser and mail integration as well as simple APIs in most languages"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Missing an ESSENTIAL feature. This app MUST add a prioritization feature to the tasks. I've been using this for almost a year and my tasks get so clobbered up even though they're organized in lists simply because there's no prioritization tags(high priority, medium priority and low priority) So I started implementing a work around d by naming the tasks but it's so disappointing to not see it natively. Please add the feature, I beg you my tasks are enormous and need proper prioritization"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"remove the app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"doesn't alert to task times every time.. Bring Back The GD location reminder ability! christ! it was so much better when I could set reminder for a place and when I got to that place, it reminded me!!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Update: Google has gone down the drain. Bug, glitchy AI, I had a feature turned off and it didn't tell me. It claims it's been reminding me of things but it hasn't. Robots won't take our jobs any time soon."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful and natively integrated in the Google ecosystem."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very good 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"nice to use, but I definitely miss a searching tool to find created tasks more easily"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The notifications disappear. Not at all useful unless you are completing your task as soon as the notification pops up. At least give me a snooze button in the notification. Just the worst reminder app ever. I want the old time nokia phones reminder experience 😭"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ok app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"there should be a high priority reminder options that behaves like alarm so that it won't be missed. and there is also a option to snooze it for 10/20/30 min/1 hr/ tomorrow/ 1 day after tomorrow option."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Unreliable notifications"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"this is a great checklist tool, but limitations like no list sharing and limited fields prevent it from being a productivity staple."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"works well just would wish they'd have better more customizable widgets"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good experience"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Delete"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It'll be much better if there's settings for widget such as themes (solid color, gradient, import local image/photo, online images), font size, font type, font color, transparency, checkmark and bulleted shapes, autohide finished task or show strikethrough for finished task with dim color or custom color, hide the rest of the phrase or wrap it under the phrase (to show complete phrase), etc"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very useful app, helps me keep my brain unxkuttered."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please add a feature like ""task of the day"" as a new task list that will automatically add all tasks from different list with due date on or before today"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"24 hr time format setting is missing. Other apps either give you the option to set it to 24hrs or takes the hint from the main phone settings."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Extremely helpful when organising your itinerary. In my opinion, it helps to give you extra format even if you have previously noted information in a calander or diary. It is definitely effective for me with my mental health and emotional well-being issues and mobility issues like when sometimes I am housebound throughout the year. So, planning is very important to me when I am able to attend events. I am typing this from my hometown, Derry Northern Ireland x ⚘️ 🌈 🌎 🇮🇪 🙏 ❤️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Overall excellent product, though would be nice to have feature that removes completed tasks after certain amount of days, instead of having to manually delete."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"sweet 😋"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"could be better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Just opened my app to get ready for my day and now everything is gone??????? App has updated all my information gone I am super mad!!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"One more feature request, if we tap the ""clear all"" button under the notifications, the active Tasks notifications also get cleared away, and there's literally no way to get those notifications back to the place. The most basic and necessary feature missing in this app is the search option. Also there should be an archive feature. Also I am not able to move the categories/labels of the reminders imported from Google assistant, they just got scattered automatically and messed up after importing."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"needs to send alerts when dates are due"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Love it but it could have more. Please make it so that when I make a list it adds to the bottom, not on top of what I've already written. Drives me insane that I have to re-order a list that I wrote in order in the first place - or write a list backwards."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"amazing how much you can get from the feed stream of recovered tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"So Google are you going to give me a ticket so you please officer now what are you going to write me a ticket for 100 bucks for not wearing my Google belt"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Helpful; a must have. Recommend it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I Like IT❣️😻 Helps me stay organized with reminders & alarms etc. I don't know where I would be without it with my Fibro Fog brain 🧠 It really has been a game changer for me❣️💯❤️‍🔥 Only thing I would like to see as an improvement is for it to actually be linked to Google Calendar, asking you if if it's for today or what date & take the remainder to your Calendar once you set tasks & then I'll definitely love it❣️😻 Get on it Google!🤔"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Somehow I receive notification of daily tasks only if I manually open the app in the evening. Btw all permissions for the app are granted in the settings."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good tool to keep on top of tasks. 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent at keeping my to-do's straight"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very good app to manage all my taskes combined with calendar and keep notes"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Setting reminders through Google assistant always worked. Ever since reminders were moved to this app, it doesn't work. No notification no sound whatever. When I open the app, sometimes the reminder appears as a notification. It's useless."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I use it as main To-do list app but it has many issues with syncing and I would expect more advanced functions from a Google app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I wish it counted the completed tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"All in all, really handy. I just wish there was a setting for deleting completed tasks automatically & permanently."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good app to track task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this will really help you"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's a very useful app for me. it helps in my daily work, office work and in my schedule."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Notification pushes dont work more than half the time rendering this app pretty much useless."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it would be nice if it integrated with other google services like maps for location based reminders. If you set a reminder to call someone you should be able to access the dialer from the app. Google has so many useful app that don't talk to each other. So much potential"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Overdue tasks trigger reminder alerts at midnight. Such a basic app and Google still can't get it right. This defect has been open for a long time. Uninstalling Tasks and trying Microsoft's version."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"absolutely banging"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app just sits silently on the phone which is not even the objective. I want a task app which talks back on my tasks and their status, allows planning flexibility, categorisation, multiple types of status updates, reminders, edit options, some kind of tasks progress and outcome tracking. I know it's a lot for a free app, but nothings free when it comes to companies like google, we are the products actually, you anyways use our data making a lot. Atleast do this for mass reach and public good"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good I guess"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"If you're looking for an extremely simple and easy to use app to keep track of your tasks, this is the one. Highly recommended!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Totally useless since any reminders now fail to notify. All permissions and notifications are enabled. Phone has been factory reset. Still no reminder notifications received"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent 👌🏿👍🏿"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Feels good to mark things completed. Simple to use. I like that they show on the calendar and can be in categories."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Would be nice if there was an option where you could view all the tasks together listed chronologically in addition to viewing them by category."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"This app never sends me a notification on the day and time I requested for any of my reminders. Sometimes if I resart my phone I will then get notifications again for my reminders I set but it's not long lived. It's ridiculous actually."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"My go-to shopping list. So simple a child can use it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Pesters people to leave a review"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"a good reminder works well through calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Unclear recurring task functionality I downloaded this app to be reminded about important calls I do every or every other week. I'm now uncertain if I can mark a call as completed or if that will make the whole recurrence go away. Really confusing GUI in that department. I'd want to mark occurrences completed, and see the next date be shown in the list instead. Also adjusting time on recurring events also does not seem to take."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helps me get more done on time"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"in love"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this is a great app for setting reminders that you don't want to clutter up your calendar with. just use the Google Assistant and set reminder for a date or say number of hours minutes seconds. and the integration with calendar so that they show up but they're not saved there so you can remove them. easier is great."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very functional, ease of use, no glitches so far"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it would be nice, if this thing would work offline"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"pretty good. needs the ability to customize lists and sublists should be ""not visible"" in normal view until that item is selected, it clutters up the list and pushes other tasks off the screen."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"amazing helpful thank for that i doing so much things easily"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very handy. Ties into Calendar nicely."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"google integration is hard to beat. but overall UI is archaic. I've used anydo for 10 yrs & its far more intuitive with less clicks & more simplicity but Google stopped letting 3rd party apps integrate w/Google assistant 🤦🏻‍♂️ Id love for a product developer to reach out to me for specific use case feedback to streamline user experience because if they get the UI streamlined 🔥 9/24/24 Still so many clicks 🤦🏼‍ 10/13/24 reschedule on notification stopped working but zero support available 🤬"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helps me stay up to date"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Dear Google team, Google Tasks is a good productivity app. However, there are a few things to improve. For instance, I suggest adding the ability to mark specific instances of recurring tasks as complete. This would provide greater flexibility and control over recurring tasks, allowing users to track progress accurately and avoid missing important deadlines. Implementing this feature would be relatively simple and straightforward technically. Thank you for considering my suggestion!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This has been a live saver, you can categorise your tasks and set them to repeat at a time of your choosing. Highly recommended."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Won't let me open any of my tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It works"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The app itself works great, but I have higher expectations - sharing lists, making list groups, adding attachments. It would be great to have integration with Google chat so tasks in chats can be created from the tasks app, not only in chats."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"no option to delete an individual day for a reoccurring task (this is possible in Google calendar). In Tasks it's either mark it as complete or delete the whole series."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Really awesome app! Works flawlessly and is very helpful you can add reminders quick and set notifications for them too. Super helpful app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"one feedback - colour coding lists so that they appear differently when viewed in Calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"don't always receive notifications so have to go to phone settings, apps, and toggle permissions once a month or so when it [doesn't] happen"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple elegant"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"does the job"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easiest app to jot down a notification reminder for something random that just came up but you need to check in x, y, or z days. 3ish clicks and you've got a notification set for any time, repeating or not. Finally someone checked how many clicks are needed to accomplish the thing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesomely awesome thank you"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very useful to stay organized"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Needs a way to sort tasks from all lists into one chronological list, so we know which task is next without going through all the lists"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I love the app. I just wish it had alarms for tasks instead of just a notification."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it is the best app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"makes my life easier"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"i wish that they would have a better notification things so your would actually see it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"there's a lot of ads, it disrupts every function on my phone and it's hard to exit out it.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app really helps you keep on, well this is too easy, task!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very easy app to set up and understand. You organize your thoughts into a simple/productive or detailed/productive day. everyday. there are other apps that have more bells and whistles. but the point of the app is to simply add your tasks for the day/month/year and include notes and times if you want. I highly recommend this for those who are moderately busy from day to day; so you can keep multi-tasking and not worry about having a journal, sticky notes, pens etc. Very Reliable!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"This app should have an inbuilt search bar to make keywords based searching easier."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Excellent app to manage different tasks. Recommended for anyone who likes organizing things to do"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"great integration with google, but needs a few more features. reminders, attach files, etc."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"not user friendly. Easy to miss important appointment or task. You must make a habbit to check list daily. This app can NOT be trusted"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"love the app and how it integrates with Google calendar, also love the widget, just wish there was a transparency option with the widget"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Please make a version of the app for wear os watches as well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"a way to get things done.... you think you write them you do"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"it keeps asking me for feedback alike other Google apps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Just getting started. I Need this application"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is a great way to organize my goals into smaller, more achievable goals. I have sections for school, work, chores, appointments, etc. It helps keep me accountable and on task. You can also access it from a computer or your phone which makes it very convenient. I highly recommend using this app. I don't usually leave reviews, but this one is worth it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works really good. I like that I can add task via Google assistant."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good app and useful. Any chance that merging lists and bulk moving of tasks could be integrated into the app? Being able to transfer completed tasks also would be great. Thanks again."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Productivity saver if ever I've seen 1... would be great to incorporate focus mode into the app, timing for tasks is something I forget to do... Great app otherwise even still"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"there's no way I can search the tasks...the search option button is missing. When I try to create a task through calendar app it always asks me for the date..this can be done away with..also when a atsk is searched through calendar it shows only the ones with a date"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Hey Google, Tasks is one of those apps that I use daily because of its minimalistic ui and widgets but I think you could add more features to make it more useful like attaching files, images and links related to the task and categories in each lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"When I asked Google to open task, it sends me to the app and then I need to open the app and only then I can see the tasks rather than open task immediately. something that need to be fixed for sure!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I use it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I rely on this daily to complete everything in my life."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Handy but one star because 1/ android app does not honor sync setting. Google does not react to bug reports 2/ cannot move tasks that have a date or recurrence"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent 👌"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"There's no way to move tags or move tasks from one place to the other, this could be improved."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Really useful and simple."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"so far so good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"very basic"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"keeps me on track, meets my needs and it's simple"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"this is a good feature. it would be a great feature if you could search within tasks by topic, name or email"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Not bad so far"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like it - easy to use!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Can't search. Can't multi select and move to another day. Pretty limited"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's a beauty widget"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Works well and very useful. It has come a long way but there is still definitely room for improvement."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"use it all the time to stay organised"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this! It helps me to remember important tasks and it's nice to check completed tasks off the list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"If you miss click or your phone dies the notifications for uncompleted tasks do not come back. A way to refresh the uncompleted takes would be helpful for not missing a task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very good as a basic to-do list manager."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So easy to use and has all the essentials to help me organize my day."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good simple app but missing a few key features, like start dates for tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I don't know I am not getting any notification of reminder"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"w app helps me keep track of my tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Simple, intuitive and works well!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"i love this tool! It is simple and has all taht is needed. It is so much more clear and better organised than google calendar. The only minor suggestion is to allow details to be added when you are creating a subtask (now you have to create a subtask fitst and then entering to add detail)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"better reminder and views for tasks within the Google calendar views"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it! The only thing I would like to see is an option to uncheck all done task. So we can use this app more like a checklist for certain task! :)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's simple to use. I like it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helps me stay organized and is very helpful and user friendly!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good to do list with no ads ."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps me keep things in order"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Search option not available. It was available in older version. Which make easy to use it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Made a Kanban board."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I really love this app I know it's got a couple weird features like organizing your tasks based on date and time but it integrates with your calendar and provides a visual checklist that really helped me get through university."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"They removed the search option from the new version."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The app is great and very useful. It being integrated with Google calendar make things even more easier and highly functional. One feedback though, sometimes the tasks are not listed date wise, which makes it a bit irritating 😑."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I get paid, to type, my name, number, and city's name! Thank you!"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good app ""To Do Task"""
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Cool 😎 As it's can keep me organized ✨️ 😌"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"nice and simple. wish tasks and task list could be shared"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple, modern and clean. Does everything it's supposed to do."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Generally useful but lacks ability to adjust event times across time zones"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"My issues in 2020: 1. Task list cannot be shared 2. Enter doesn’t add next subtask 3. Sorting tasks by date merges subtasks with main tasks. 4. No normal web version 5.⭐ Starred tasks can’t sort. My issues in 2024: Same except no. 4 ⭐ Why can't starred tasks be moved !?!?😭"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google Tasks does what it's supposed to do, and the UI is incredibly clean."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple and effective"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"the best task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"does it's job now you can organize order pf the lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"could use some more features."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Live it!! great for my memory🥴"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Veo la posibilidad de agregar colores para identificarlos y cuando se junten en la lista de estrella aparezcan ordenadas según importancia, color o fecha"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works well with assistant"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Absolute great app. Please add the ability to start the week from Mon. And also shortcut widget to add task without opening the app. Thank you :) It would be the greatest app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Makes planning tasks very easy to do. I had no hassle once I learned how Tasks works."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Handy & straightforward to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app - just needs a SEARCH function, Google! lol"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"keeps me on track!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"the app really gives me a view of my task an keeps me aware of the task I need to complete"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"would not be as effective as I am without these reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Love tasks and I rely on them every day but this new UI update stinks. Why all the whitespace around everything?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I use this every single day. Best app I've found so far for keeping track of my to-do lists, shopping lists, reminders, etc. Love that it integrates with my Google calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"i wish the tasks widget could be modified to be partially translucent on Samsung phones"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very helpful, keeps me organized, and it's free!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I recently started using Google Task app... Everything is okay, just that there is no Snooze option, when the task is opened (on being triggered). Though one can Snooze by long pressing the notification icon, but once the app is opened, then there's no Snooze option. Provide a Snooze option."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Can't get sound for tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"really handy and it's sinced with my computer."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Reading"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful app... thanks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best To Do / Task app EVER!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Could do with an in app search function but still 5*"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Lots of issuing features. This is an afterthought-app that survives on its Google origin."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love this app, use it in my business to stay organized. I have completed over 1000 tasks! It's simple and gives me exactly what I need, nothing more."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this makes tracking the completion of tasks very easy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very helpful and easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"overall works awesome do I wish there were a couple more features? definitely"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great little app from Google. Use almost daily to add ""must do"" taks or reminders into my calendar. Seamless integration with Google Calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice to know that I'm not forgetting to do anything for a change!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Request to add more features to enhance user experience at workplace with this tools"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Doesn't have recurring tasks and reminders, please add that. [Edit] now it's added"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great simple app! Only problem: The Undo-button overlays the list, so one sometimes needs to wait for it to disappear before being able to put finished tasks back on the list (needed for daily repeating lists)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"really useful & well designed. simple to use, with just the right facilities I need."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app for all your tasks organized"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple to use, well designed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app and easy fo use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this app helps me a lot"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It works well, there are some bugs or things that could work with more efficiency, but it is a nice app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it's ok. on tasks with long details it auto advances to the end of the list which is annoying"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Expecting a web interface."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Everything you need from a task-based list with no bloat. Love it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I use it every moment every day, it's the most flexible app for managing my personal growth. Thanks Google👌"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Your program is still open to hackers. Believe I would love to remove him from my software, hard drive, and all files."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google runs my life for me. thank you, Google."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Switched from a similar app that never worked, to be this app and lovd it. No complaints and it syncs to my Google calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Super simple, not a lot of features, but does the job well. If you just want a basic check list on your phone you can't get much better. Apple's reminders app has a larger feature set and has the simple aspects of this app, so it's all round better, but if you have an android and don't care about anything more than a digital version of your paper check list your best choice is this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Task is Easy and Great way to reminder in the individualistic world."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I can make whatever task I would like to get done each day, and you change the task whenever and add more if you like"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's nice n simple. I've used it for years. Perhaps the ability to add voice recordings and photos should be looked into."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"useful but very limited features, unable to link emails, urls, docs or calendar appointments, and limited grouping. almost no ability to share or transfer tasks with others. amount of details you can store in a task is very low and text only."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Affective and user friendly"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Installed on GP9XL and it is always on and draining battery. During a day's monitoring it is top of my battery usage and there are no current tasks set."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"absolutely amazing app. it helps me alot getting control of chores and appointments"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not impressed. I want to like this app, it seems so clean and simple. You can't do much customization, but the worst thing is that once you mark off a recurring task, you then have to delete checked tasks before it will show up aslt the next occurrence. How is that useful at all?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great but I would like to make the widget transparent and a bit of colour choices with text would be nice."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"sometimes when I create a reminder while driving, it adds to the calendar and doesn't pop up as a notification but overall great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Data antri"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great way to track yourself. can you have a range of dates for a task. this can be an improvement. also consider linking it to calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"sigma"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for adhd'ers"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great, simple task management app. My only gripe is when adding tasks to a list you don't have the option to do ""next task"" straight from the task you are creating; you have to save the task, close out the window, then add another. Really a small inconvenience but it's a bit clunky. That, and Google will probably randomly decide to discontinue it at some point."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Just what I need and integrates with the apps I use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't actually pop up with notification reminders anymore despite all settings being correct"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Good, but I think it's need to add some features!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Still learning. But all seems good and simple. May learn more for tricks and tips."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"it works poorly. trying to give instructions, but it's not following through."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Essential........................."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great way to stay ahead"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Task doesn't sync with my computer task. The application changed the tome for my task 5 hours from their designated time. Changed them on the app, and it sends them to weird times on the computer and even on the google calendar. Weird, but I definitely spent too much time trying to fix the issues with no resolution."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love Google"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Imprevo"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Still reviewing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I believe that it should also have some sort of Alarm type Alert on it as well as the notification.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Basic in design but is effective"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Get my money 🤑💰"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The app has started assigning times to tasks, then displays a countdown on my home page. These unsolicited times are a distraction, as there's no way to delete/ override them. Please turn this off, and only use the times I set."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Awesome App."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Task list widget has been silently removed. Please restore it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I'm satisfied using it. I hope it will be much better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The app doesn't remind me daily of tasks despite setting the reminder to repeat daily. This used to work flawlessly when it was part of google assistant. Now I have to use the clock and set an alarm to be reminded reliably."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good app 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful... I love marking completed once the task is done"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Gud"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I never hear a single notification from this app and have actually missed tasks because of it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The reminder notification never goes off so it's a completely useless app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I don't have a zero rating, otherwise I would not have liked to give it, the main reason for this is, as soon as I install this app, I don't get any reminder notification on my mobile, Because of this I have suffered a lot, I had many important meetings which I could not attend, I am using vivo V 27."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I have no idea why it's only three notifications a week can it be just notification where did you come with this stupidity and how to make it a limited or 10 or 20 I don't get notification again do I have to reinstall the app and by the way every upgrade you make is the same thing bug fixed you don't even bother right what's going on the nerd became too busy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I find this app useful, but lately have not been able to move tasks between lists. Wish they would bring that back. It's more convenient than re-creating the same task in a different list then deleting from the other list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"always on time really very use for me . I love it . Very useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Oishi pori"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not working punctually. My daily ""drink water"" reminders don't appear during day. In fact, they appear late night..! What's the point of setting reminders here?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Subscribe"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simply is the best. I like that I can add several items to favourite list to focus on and it has widget too. If the app allows to change order of tasks to do now is so perfect."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Liked the widget view of the task list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is well integrated into the Google framework. It has helped me to stay focused and achieve my goals."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"well, everybody has some type of task and it's very useful to make one."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"definitely the best app for busy minds"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I'm figure. It is me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Interesting Tasks Google App ETC."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very user friendly"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great for ToDos"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"thank you very good."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Tenia yn roye to con esta aplicacion y UN hacker me la llevo"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Keeps great track of my to do lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works fine"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Yes I still used paper and pen to jott down things/tasks I❤️this app , which is now part of my life (note can type📲any task that come to mind that I think about at times 😍 just 🤔 . Why⁉ do I keep things /task to do and remember at times up in my head my mind when I could just use/have this app as I think about these things(tasks etc. and voice type- record them when they come into my mind and yes! this Google task app is amazing.👌 Try it out I think you'll love it for real God bless you 🙏"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's very convenient in terms of integration with other Google apps, simple, and straightforward, but could really do with being just a tad more fleshed out. It needs: - integration with Google Keep - the ability to add more than one level of subtasks - stronger linking of subtasks with parents tasks - a dedicated attachment section (links only would be fine), for any files from GDrive, events from GCal, contacts, images, etc... Just adding these would really elevate the app's usefulness."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"You have to add a section of routine"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Dark mode is not working properly, the text is also appear in black in widget mode"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"PETITION TO ADD 'DESCRIPTION' FOR EACH LIST to state specific info which should be displayed at the top of the list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"𝕀𝕥 𝕨𝕒𝕤 𝕒 𝕘𝕣𝕖𝕒𝕥 𝕖𝕩𝕡𝕖𝕣𝕚𝕖𝕟𝕔𝕖"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Cool app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app but should have an alarming sound and notification which should not stop and go away respectively unless a user does not stop the alarming sound and make the notification go away when the time of task comes"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"so far so good I'm getting task completed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice and easy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love it! Does everything I need."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Aanit panik patel"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It needs good patience/ confidence n trust to achieve the success concerned. 謝謝 感恩。"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"too basic tick tick app is so better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"sometimes it doesn't remind you, then what's the need of this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"would like it to integrate with more apps but overall great to use in order to organize tasks and ensures I stay organized."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Formulate"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Please add color options to the tasks!! Color code the lists, color code individual tasks. Something! You can color code events but you can't mark the events as done. If the tasks could be color coded this would be perfect for me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Too basic and confusing."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is fantastic. It has a minimal, clean UI which is the most important aspect for me. All I want is to make quick notes of tasks I need done and check them off. That's it. There's no unnecessary clutter and it feels very intuitive and streamlined. I tried some other apps and they were more cluttered and less intuitive, so I'm sticking with this for now (please don't screw it up, Google)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Keep me posted all the time updates on tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good because it is very simple to use even for people who prepare themselves for their work This app is good without any distraction and has no ads"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"this app is very good for planing in day to day"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it's so much better to memorise thinking but one of the suggestions remains with Ring or Alarm so it's better otherwise it's helpful 😁"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"bro good stuff"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"not sending notification"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Some task notification doesn't pop up in notification bar. Please solve this bug. Not expected from such a big developer"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Kindly introduce the option to add dates to sub tasks also"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"helpful and simple to use, but it would be great if there was a way to assign tasks and schedule a notification to appear on another person's account, either for family or business. if that was an option I would use it instead of what I do now which is sending a calendar invite to remind family to do chores and other important things."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"reminders does not work totally unacceptable to do a factory reset"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Can we have the option to rearrange lists, please 🙏"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Keep updating it and adding new features! This app is a 💎"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works awesome for tracking a regular to do list. Super easy to use!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I didn't need a new app for tasks. it was fine in the calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great way to keep track of a busy schedule"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"For unknown reasons, this app never notify about each task at its specified time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Still waiting for big upgrade for UI Categories needed in Task such as Priority, regular etc as well as notification period for Priority is more than regular"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very helpful for my pending tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminders are not working after the latest update. Please fix the issue as soon as possible"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I need a strikethrough option, especially for subtasks. Currently when you mark a subtask as done it moves to the completed tasks list, subtasks aren't listed under tasks in the completed list either. This makes it really difficult to keep an overview of more complicated tasks. My current workaround is using the star ⭐ meant to mark important tasks as a marker for completed subtasks. The pro of this app is having tasks and calander from the same service provider."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helps with keeping tabs on my daily routines"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"needs to be searchable!!! does not have timestamps for when an item was added"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"A good application overall, but could use some improvements like an alarm or a reminder before the actual time of a task, some additional functionalities like location of task, recording responses as a result of the task and stuff like that."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It is very helpful for everyone I have been using it for 15 day I wish I knew about this early."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I just wish there was a better way for this platform to notify me better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I like it, i will use it but there is some improvement that could be made to make it better."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Love the UI, but organizing different lists is limited in functioning - still, it's better than most other task apps."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"okok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Confusing and no reminders that I can find"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Mozambique manica"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"love the simplicity. But it lacks features"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's not bad"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"very bad app don't waste your time going for another even if this app doesn't deserve 1 Star"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Could use location-based reminder. Also pictures and documents support would be a great help."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Fake app Not Useful No Task 6 month See No any Task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"@THANKS FROM GOD"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good app 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Desktop plugin tasks are not displayed，And often fail to remind in time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Superb!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I just wish you could share tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It doesn't show notifications for the tasks that are due even though the time was given"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice Apps. It's easy to used and fast 🤲"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Support me in ♥️👉🔓👉💯🙏"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"There's no option to view all tasks at once. I initially thought that's what the ""my tasks"" tab was for but turns out it's just a group like any other. Very frustrating"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Is it because it's so integrated into everything and an almost forced into it's use or is it really that good? Would I make the choice of using this had it not been pre-loaded onto my phone? I'm sure there's other options I could benefit from and have more settings but none have the ability to be available everywhere as this is plus Google assistant works perfectly which is almost how this sits above the rest"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Please add another 'Drop-down' sections for 'past expired/overdue' & 'upcoming' tasks just like completed tasks."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google Tasks provides a great workspace to put in our tasks along with reminders that have multiple options. It allows us to group our tasks categorically helping us stay organized. These tasks can also appear on the Google calendar to give you a larger picture of things. I'm finding this app very useful! The only feedback I would give is to have the option of incorporating Gemini into the app like in Keep Notes, so we can use AI to make lists and tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"When i install this app, the reminders stop alerting me . When i uninstall, everything goes normal. I set reminders using google assistant"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"there's no feature for an hourly reminder"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"best 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Does NOT remind me of tasks. Like at all. Sometimes if I go in and open the app I'll be flooded with all the missed ones/ones I never got a notification/ reminder for. All of my settings allow for notification delivery, it's definitely the app that's the problem."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"On ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"i like that there is a simple widget. I don't like that there isn't a way to mark an incomplete task"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"What an app that reminds me of when you need to finish your tasks! Really awesome! 💙🤍💙❤️💛💚"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Ok. Im Googles biggest fan, and test multiple apps and services for them, as well as learning to develop with their developers program. So when I say that tasks is an absolutely terrible app, it pains me to say it, yet my words couldn't be any more true. It has never worked to alert me about tasks. I've attempted to use it periodically hoping this issue would be resolved, but I don't think the apps potential is being taken seriously. I'm a workspace subscriber, and I still have to use other apps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"basic"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good but google needs to rethink about the UI. If there are so many custom lists we need to horizontal scroll infinitely to get to the list, which is not convenient. Need a Sidebar for easy access all the lists, need option to collapse the sub list and when all sublist items are marked complete the task needs to be automatically marked as complete."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent product, solution till now."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"so far good it is minimal and that is what i was looking for"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google Tasks is a simple and useful tool for organizing daily to-do lists. It’s easy to add tasks, set deadlines, and mark them complete. The app syncs across devices, which is great for staying on track anywhere. Especially the subtask option is helpful to me. However, it would be even better if there was an option for recurring tasks, making it easier to manage repeating tasks without re-entering them. Overall, a helpful app for staying organized!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I love how the app works with Google assistant, but I want that widget to be transparent the way the other widgets have the transparency slider. Plz update so my homepage can be beautiful and I can use ur widget. Plz?!?? 🙏🙏🙏"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"i like it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Overall, it's a great app, but it could benefit from additional features such as priority-based task settings, background color options for different tasks and subtasks, or the ability to categorize tasks based on various criteria and much more so needs a better update."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"lots of basic features are not implemented, subtasks, drag and drop, it's very inconvenient when you can press backspace and it brings you to the task above it, it's better if you cant move through the task by pressing enter or backspace"

Just opened the app. In process of entering a medication tasking. Its a 3 part(time of day) a.m., p.m., nite structure, with 10 (or 12, PRN) types of meds at various times. Finding it may not work on this app; as it appears its a one-and-done line entry. Will advise more, and complete rating later."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reoccurring tasks are implemented in the most frustrating way possible. Within the tasks app, when you complete a reoccuring task, it doesn't show you the next one until when it's due. All other tasks apps immediately shows you it. And in the calendar app, it shows ALL the upcoming tasks. So if I set it to remind me to meditate every day, it clutters my next 30 days on my calendar with meditate on each day. It should only show one occurrence at a time. Who designed this?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"literally exactly what I have been looking for. I added all of my work tasks and have been doing so much better the last week."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Thank"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I used to love this app for its simplicity in managing multiple to-do lists. Before, you could view all your lists as a comprehensive list, which made it easierto find specific ones. With the recent update, you can now only navigate between lists through tabs in the header. This change has made it much more difficult to locate a list, especially since there’s no option to sort them alphabetically. It’s frustrating and slows down the user experience significantly."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Not good performing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Easy to use and helpful for organizing tasks on different lists and by due date. I like being able to favorite/star specific items as being important. I wish there was a way to see all items from your various lists on one combined list so I can see everything I plan to do today/tomorrow/this week, etc. I sometimes use the star list to do this as a workaround, but then I lose the insight to what my true important tasks are."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google tasks is quite practical and efficient with no nags and in-the-face ads. if any shortcoming it should have basic Rich text formatting capability such as bold, underline, strikethrough, etc. otherwise, quite useful and convenient to keep track of tasking by categories."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"No ability to collaborate on tasks. Also, the Google Tasks API does not let other apps read the due time, just the due date; this has been requested for years with no action taken."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Best thing is that the sync is pretty fast. I can access my lists in all places. Only one missing feature though, there is option to see started items, there should be option to see items with date within a week in a single view as well."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Phone restart = Missed Reminders PLEASE add the option for notifications (and snoozed ones) to reappear upon a restart/power off etc. I've missed so many reminders because of this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this app. As someone who has trouble with focus and remembering to do things it's so good. You can add it as a widget on your home screen and I have it set up for taking my medication daily. It's also easy to add tasks from the home screen which can be customised. It is especially helpful to open my phone and then think ""oh yeah I forgot I had to make that phone call, I should do that."""
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Make it go away. I don't want it!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It's a great app but so much wasted space with limited customisation. It should have options where users can select how the theme and arrangement should look. Something similar to Google Keep."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's simple and it works. It can't quite replace calendar, but it's a great backup"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please give us the option to see future repeating tasks. I shouldn't have to go to calendar to edit future repeats. And why did you get rid of the list button? It was such an easy way to see all of my lists."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"This was an app I was excited to get a chance to use. It did not however, do its job all too well. I didn't get my reminders on time. I couldn't personalize the outlook etc. This made me rarely open the app. It looks like an app that was built in 1990 honestly."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The Best 💜"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Your app is very basic it can be improve a lot please take guidance from app like ticktick Your application can be so much better because of the Google integration with all ecosystem. Please improve it and make it little bit useable... Very basic features like setting up a multiple custom task with the time slot for each day repeatedly is too difficult And there is not option to postpone or skip the pending task only way is to complete it.

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I miss the old Google reminders outside of the Tasks app. If I set a reminder (or make a ""task"") on my phone, I will only see the reminder show up on my Google Home tablet hours after I needed the reminder. My notification settings are all set to on for Tasks, but I still don't get reminders. I've started setting timed reminders for myself in my phone's calendar instead which takes longer and is less convenient. Edit 09/2024: This app still doesn't send me reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Is so very helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Not entirely sure why would the developers not think of giving a 'search' option within the app!!! I was under the impression, search feature has pretty much become a standard feature across apps these days..."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Great app till a list being worked on was gone after having to walk away for a few minutes.

It really sucks that it didn't hold all that was in the list as not finished but just completely erased it like it was never listed. Thanks for nothing!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Please provide search option among the tasks we have entered in the app. Is there any provision to 'search' any particular task, from a whole lot of tasks ? Provision to Search is required. Provide for repeat tasks hourly & minutes option."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"timer facility also available for special task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The Google Reminders feature has just gotten worse and worse over the years and I don't like that you're forced to download another app now just to have another substandard version of it.

I first had to just remember, which did not go well, then I would have to set alarms which were so loud.

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's Great application"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Latest update eliminated the Task List . New update you have to scroll across the top to find task. Takes longer to find your task List. Whoever revised this must not be able to multi-task, which is why people use this to start with."

Other then that super great app Edit 14-02-2022 I do think the prior layout withe button layout in the bottom navbar was better. I see material design now puts the main action on the bottom right. The centered button was much easier to click, both for left and right handed people Edit 29-08-2024 Some of the latest update added option to quickly order the lists. So nice!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"always fails to pop up and actually remind"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Allow ability to sort task A-Z. Also allow us to choose a list to permanently pin to our notifications."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"you can't delete tasks in the app, only mark as completed. Through the web you can do both. maybe it's just a glitch on my end."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent 👌"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"New UI is horrible and wastes space that could be used for the longer task descriptions. Do they only do one word tasks? Probably. Also, one tap on a notification and all notifications go away. Very bad! Old: Google has screwed up another app. I used to really enjoy using this but now I can't even move a task to another list anymore. Google is going crazy or stupid from all the diverse ""drugs""."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"fine"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It's mind-boggling that there isn't a built-in feature in Google Tasks to sort completed tasks chronologically. This can be very frustrating, especially if you like to track your progress over time. Also, the search option is missing. Why? 👎"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I don't like the new layout. Too much wasted space. I had mentioned before that the star was wasted space for me (but I realize some people might find it useful). This latest version is simply wasted space. Too much horizontal border. Some tasks that used to fit on one line now take two lines. What used to be a one-screen viewing now requires scrolling."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"really good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Really great app. easy to use and cam create multiple tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"So far so good although I need help with setting subtasks. It doesn't allow me to do so with some of the tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A very good tool to manage daily tasks recommended app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Would be better if the subtasks remain within the main task when completed. Other than that it's perfect."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Worth it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love the tasks app and how it connects effectively too my calender. I like the desktop google calender - tasks hybrid better than having two separate apps on my phone, but I'm not complaining, the subtle extra convenience of merging them on mobile really wouldn't change my life that much."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it's a simple list. I can't figure out how to undo an accidental completed task it just went away!! not good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Learn more"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"if I can remember this it would work better!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"When I click on notification. App marks the task as completed. Thereis no option to change task date time if required. From completed list if I have to reschedule any task, It is not possible. Sometime, I don't get any alert/notification for some tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It has really helped get everything out of my head and on to a schedule. It has also tremendously helped with communication with my team on what needs to get done. I also use this at home to manage chores, filter changes and other things that need to get done. Since it shows up on our home screen, it helps my husband get in my head and it helps me stay disciplined with the things im responsible for."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"lo mejor."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Could be netter"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"fantastic app"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"buena App, swria bueno agregar colores para distinguir más rápido, y de ponerse conectar con las notas keep, eso y también que en la lista de estrellas se pueda ordenar a voluntad las tareas"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This app lets me create and manage tasks. I really like it, but it sometimes gets confusing, mainly the design. This app is good, but I would really like it if you guys furnish it a little more. some suggestions: 1. Add a dropdown menu to show/hide the subtasks 2. Let us be able to add subtasks to subtasks 3. Make the editing layout a bit better, add a save button to save changes, and not automatically save them"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Satisfied login"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like; the more integration the better."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Its a great app that never forgets to remind you of your tasks when needed."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"is a good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"You have to manually put in tasks from Google calendar and I wish this would automatically sync all the Google calendar events if this could be changed that would be cool :D"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's very good. It helps me to remember about my tasks and it always helps me for time management. This app very clear to use. It uses a small space in my memory. I highly recommend this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app is so basic, you can't even reverse sort your tasks, and logically it makes no sense to have the last task land at the top of the list. It seems like this app was delivered on a Friday by a summer intern."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love that when you open the app it goes straight to lists and swiping between lists is much better than stepping back to a menu. It's extremely straight forward, just like making a list with pen and paper. The only feature that I could see being nice is a smart list that shows all tasks. If and only if I click to make it as a new list. Other than that it is perfect and that is bearly an issue. Not trying to do too much."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"wonderful organizational tool"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Already installed on my other 📱 yesterday. Needed too transfer a important 🗃️ over too this 📱 as well. Because the last important live 🗃️ the beginning of August on chrome 😱 crashed and I lost everything on it. All the valuable information I needed in my new NHS diet. So this time round I added the new NHS diet too nearly everything on my phone 📱 now too this phone 📱 in Google task's only and file's safe storage. Incase the phone's 📱📱 application's crash yet again 👀 Ⓜ️ Loft 🙄"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I love this app. But the last update introduced a thick border around the list area. The result is a loss of nearly 10% of the horizontal space. Is the border really necessary?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"precise, clear, and connected to my other google based apps. this was exactly what I needed!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This app is such a lifesaver. I love how it's minimalistic but highly efficient. However, I really wish there was a way to see all the tasks from all the different lists, like an all tasks section."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Overall a good experience."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"great, simple app for tracking tasks. There should be a way to keep subtasks organized under tasks when organizing by date."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good, simple app that just works."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It works"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Annoying in that it doesn't integrate well into my google calendar. Sometimes notifications go unnoticed unless specifically checked. Would be better if app had inbuilt tutorial and feedback"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I have given this in feedback already but when moving tasks around to the order you want them they don't stay that way and change every day. for days I have been adding times for my daily tasks to keep them in order of what I have to do. but everyday they just kept changing back. I find going into calendar helped but I really shouldn't have to do this or add times at all for it to stick to the order I set it at."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I wish I had the ability to share my tasks with somebody else. apart from that the app is perfect."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good app!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good tool, once I was able to add the app into my workflow, I found the performance gain and structure that it bought to my day was well worth the effort. Now I have about an hour more for the important work, like enjoying the reading of my comic books and grading the collection ready to go up for sale on my site. It does matter!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good app but needs more customization. I like how I can see my tasks on my Google Calendar, however it would be great to find tune and have my individual tasks lists show in different colors on my Google Calendar. another features that needs to be added on the Tasks app, instead of repeating tasks going into a ""Completed"" section, you need to take note from Microsoft Todo and have the completed task go to the bottom of the list instead. I use this app to track weekly and month bills."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Need more widgets"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Random timing for notifications :( missed my medications alot"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I wish lists were sharable and a little more easy to organize with categories and collapsible substacks. ,and maybe also more levels"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The Best"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Google Tasks is an awful replacement for reminders. It would be better if I could use Google Keep as my default reminder app. The Google task app fails to display notifications most of the time and lacks the ability to set a task based on location. And its integration with assistant is very disappointing, the majority of the time when I ask assistant to set a reminder or task it fails to do so through assistant and I have to open the task app and manually create it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I LIKE THE WAY IT WORKS AND ALWAYS BE ON TIME! I'M ENJOYING MY GOOGLE TASKS THANK YOU!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's great, but needs improvement. There is no truly perfect app. There's always room for improvement. That is all"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's an excellent app for scheduling engagements. I could have given it a 5 star if there was a alarming system on the scheduled date and time. Otherwise, it's a very useful app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I wish that could connect to clocks alarm 🤣"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"could be more open towards other task management services. just like the calendar app, it would be great if it could aggregate tasks from both the google account and the Microsoft 365 To-do service."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This is a very minimal but useful tasks app. But there are a few features like recycle bin for lists, full control over tasks' notifications that are missing."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This app is useful for students 🙂"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"helps my day to day go as planned better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Install this app for notifications, notifications aren't working with app installed, uninstall it and Google Assistant remind me notifications work just fine through the Calendar app. Great experience, working as intended"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple, easy and highly efficient way to structure your game plan and set your actions on a train to reality."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Just too basic. Lacking repeating subtasks, no location based tasks, no good sorting system. Why even make this if it's going to be made substandard?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"a great app on your phone to quickly write down things you mean to do later, and helps you from forgetting it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I've been using my notepad (both paper and digital) before to keep track of my To-dos. Tried using this app once and I didn't continue for some reason. Now I've come back to it and I can say that this is a real lifesaver! PS: if it had the option of using alarms instead of notification pop-ups, that'll be superb!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"keeps me organized and motivated"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The notification cannot be oppened with single click... it take multiple attempts to open it and take it to the app to modify or delete the task.

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Need to be able to share with other people"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Any accidental press on the widget circle before the task on the home screen leads to missing the task completely. There should be an option to lock the task on the home screen."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Really nice, just wish the sorting was more detailed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"decent task tool. frustrated by the fact that ""hey Google"" will only let you create a new task if it has an alarm."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love how everything google made is the best for eg g-board tasks, drive, etc"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Best app for to do lists,the completed section should be in front of the tasks so the person can feel ""not greatly burdened with tasks""."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The handiest app that Google has for keeping you organized and is one of the best things I use for my nonprofit organization to keep appointments, notes, donations, messages, and anything else I need to have done for myself, as well as personal items I have to tend to. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I reserve 5 stars for The Creator and Son for their abilities. Blessings 🙏🏻"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"gool"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The app DOES NOT notify you on time or ever sometimes. Google has to stop ruining it's products."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ok🌟🌟🌟🌟"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, for a quick note, or remainder"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I use it multiple times daily, but it needs to have an alphabetical sort option to get 5 stars from me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"easier to use events and keep everything in one spot. in addition the notification feature seems to never work."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Lacks some features you would think it should have like task list sharing or color coding different lists in Google Calendar but good basic features."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"BudhRaj"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The Tasks app is so easy to use and I use it frequently to help keep myself organized."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Sometimes, it's easier to use Google Tasks. Sometimes, it's easier to use Google Calendar. Sometimes, it's easier to use Google Keep. For the most part, this app just takes the schedule design on Calendar and removes your events."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google Tasks is fantastic! It effectively helps me stay organized and complete most of my pending work. The intuitive design and seamless integration make task management a breeze. Highly recommended!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"There's no way to set a time duration for your tasks. All tasks you enter are automatically given the default time of 30 minutes. So if you think a task will take you 2 hours to complete, you'd have to enter that task four times into the app. Without the ability to set the time duration of your tasks, this app is completely useless."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app.. Widgets are really useful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Needs task durations. Otherwise the integration with Google calendar is almost pointless. Other than that, simple, and works well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It has the one feature I was looking for that their competitor app doesn't have, which is to mass delete all completed items, but there's no ability to share your lists with others for collaboration (like a household shopping/to do list). Not being able to share and collaborate make this app useless for my needs. I also wish the list of lists was in a different format (like in a column style menu vs scrolling the top banner)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps that Google has is this Google tasks app. It's super helpful to organize tasks into lists (like for work/home/life/shopping) tasks don't always need to have a date, but when it does it's added to the calendar. While my task list (for my Trans Canada Bike Route Network project) is huge, I wish there was a way to share this list publicly so others can comment on it and add sub-tasks. (Then it can be like a GitHub list)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Удобно, всего в голове не удержишь"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"concise, precise and purposeful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's a good app, but please make a wear os version of tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I would prefer to use the Google calendar for my REMINDERS THIS APP NEVER GOES OFF. U need to make it so we can change the tone separately instead of having to use the same tone for notifications. App still doesn't work. Now the tasks hardly ever go off After ur done with the task it's supposed to automatically go to the next one, but it doesn't. I have to sinc tasks quite often. App still doesn't work so you guys need to fix this issue now!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Find it to be a duplicate app. Think device has app like this pre installed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best Software and I have a very good experience"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"keeps me up to date and informed!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Wow... Talk about minimal and bare-bones! Doesn't support 24 hour time format, can't set a custom notification, no options at all. Then again it's a Google app, so expectations need to be set low..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Latest version, 2024.07.29.657..., is just trash. I did not need another border around my lists for God's sake!!! The card layout is a complete waste of space and everything feels way too cramped. Also, where is the button for getting a list of all lists? How do you reorder lists now? This is why Google's app updates are so frustrating. They always ruin something with poor design. Stop fixing things that aren't broken. I so wish I had made a backup of the older version :⁠-⁠("

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"when I click a task it just disappears I want to mark it finished but I don't want it to disappear until I decide to delete. todone lists are sometimes more useful then to do so this tasks list is useless unless I can use it this way. but not checking it off makes it confusing cause then why did I make the list and not just keep it in my head? I was hoping it was just a setting but if it is it is not obvious."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The to-do list can use more layers than 2"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I really appreciate the functionality of the Google Tasks widget, but I've noticed a usability issue. The text in the widget often gets cut off with ellipses (...) before the full task name is displayed. This makes it difficult to quickly scan my tasks at a glance. It would be much more helpful if the widget displayed the full task name, similar to how the Google Keep widget handles note titles. Please consider this as a feature improvement in a future update. Thank you"

I created a reminder to put my retainers in every 2 days, as I write this review I've just taken them out after putting them in last night, Tasks is now telling me I need to put them in again tonight... Same thing is happening with another reminder that I have set to happen every 2 days. This app is completely unusable for me and useless, I don't know how you can mess the basics up."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very useful to manage and track different types of tasks on day to day basis.

""Your single-use code"" (literally an OTP email from Microsoft). There's no way for me to change settings at all.

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Everything was good about this app but I request Google to add a feature like live task where we set a specific time interval for that task and it reminds you to start that task at a particular time after time interval ended it give you 2 option one is mark as complete and other is I needed some more time that feature will be good for students taking recorded lecture let less waste their time on doing more productive and complete their task without any backlog"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"GREAT THINGS . Pls upgrade it with a long notification tune like an alarm ."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"perfect 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app widget doesn't show the task on home screen which make it useless for me. Its widget is showing just blank task on home screen."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"fantastic app! I highly recommend it to everyone!"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's really great for my ADHD"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A very useful app to organise & remind daily, weekly, monthly and yearly. Adding notes on reminders are also very helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"To developers, this task isn't going to help me retrieve my erased emails I excidently deleted from my device not saving my passwords? I tried everything thinking that my fingerprint would recognize my identity. No luck, your code that is sent my number is not taking me to change my password either. Any suggestions? Please"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Not bad. Easy calendar taks adds."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I hope to get purchase order of PLF-24-005"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"More complicated to set a reminder, this app does not have the versatility ""my reminders"" had. My reminders would come up on my full lock screen, and allow me the option to snooze reminders for a set amount of time. Google tasks is just complicated to use, and is not good at being a visual reminder as the reminders from Google tasks hide in the notification drop down. Extremely disappointed, I need to find an app that I can use with Android assistant that functions like ""my reminders""."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Convenient for creating tasks and reminders are helpful. I've got a feature suggestion: could you add different colours for task card and/or text, please? It would help to quickly see important tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"no ability to start task from latest days"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's just OK. Nothing special. Missing the capability to mark tasks not completed. Control over repeating tasks is less full-featured than in the Google Calendar web app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"useless app, still cannot setup if i want email or push notification etc..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Loved that I can add subtasks and also there is repetition for days"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"really good. The subtasks dont stay inder their headings when you arrange them by date or time and the alarm isnt very noticeable but its not bad. To be honest its staggering, the low quality of life software has these days but hey its good compared all the other free stuff..."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Kavita Sagar Ahire"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I'll request a feature! When we receive a notification that says ""Mark as completed,"" the app should offer an additional option. If enabled, this option would allow us to set a specific time interval. So, whenever we get a notification, it would say ""Remind me in # (minutes/hours)"" based on the interval we set."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this app is a must for me as I have a brain injury and I have very little short term memory so it's a vital part of my life and would struggle without it being able to get reminded of appointments 10 out of ten for me"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"useful. I use the AI assistant to set reminders and seems to work fairly well"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Well, it's a nice wee App to have on your phone, but it doesn't allow for collaboration and sharing tasks, which makes it in turn useless. Got to find other providers to simply share a task list. Very poor. @Google In which world do you live? People want Apps that work on all platforms (Android, Windows, OSX, etc.) and allow for interaction. If you can't deliver, you users go elsewhere, like I will."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"satisfied"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Sharing tasks with others option is working only in desktop not in mobile application. If it's there is mobile then its great. And also even in desktop if other person whom we have shared task if he completes it the person who has given task is not able to see. For this two reasons i have given 3 stars otherwise remaining things i am happy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"you can easily manage your works only jut write in tasks app and follow your task one by one. whenever you finished your task tick chech marks. I'm regularly use this app it's very useful"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's intuitive to use. Quite simple and easy to add tasks and organise them. I can't reorganise them easy though you'll have to delete the task and add to the right category. No colours can be added. It's ok for a free app I guess."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very handy productivity app"

You need an app that includes these type- ""Photo's to be posted on line, for business."" This has lost me several days, because you lack this option."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"excellent app. simple and reliable. would be even better if it had a desktop app, however, and for that I'll need to use a competitor."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Make a functionality where nunbers on todo list automatically get summed. For example here' s checklist Electric Bill - 1000 Water bill - 600 Food - 400 Then there's a button below to show autosum of all the number.

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Very useful in the Google workspace ecosystem except it lacks the option to force stick in the notification bar of android smartphone."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Tried to balance."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The developers did a great job it is very simple and easy even for those stupid people like myself. I am sorry I didn't have use for anything to move forward.i simply have nothing left to manage start or even a dime left .no equipment no capital just a stupid dream. Dream I would love to call reality A freaking nightmare. Great job to the developers though."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy to use. it'd be great if you could have an alarm option for tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Thanks again for the supporting"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Please add search capabilities. No need to keep this much light weight"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"i love the option to star task from different lists and i can see all of them as one new list just what I was looking for 😀"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I was unaware of this great app and tried Many routine and scheduling apps. This is my favorite!! and it's FREE! Simply reset each night and the widget is ready to begin for whatever you made it for (my routine.)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Everything I don't wanna forget, I put here as a reminder and it works for me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I really love they way is easier for me to be reminded of what I want to do, on a daily basis. 😊😁"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I'm not happy that when I scheduled items to reoccur monthly they are showing up as two months out not every month. This needs fixing asap!"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"love the app. wish they did a collaboration with Samsung Reminders too. that way, all the tasks would by synced *edited: 4 stars: Please fix the lag when switching between different lists. Tried it on 2 phones and both lag in that stage."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Hacked one trillion times and still counting"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"no easy way to share tasks with others from the app.. which is what I was looking for."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simply wotks and works simply. Does exactly what I need it for."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice app for student in managing the day to day time and also beneficial in making task and completing them on time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"A solid to do list solution"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"so special"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Will not send notifications."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The notification sound is the default sound of my phone. So, I can't tell if I got a text message or just another task notification. There is no feature to customize the notification sound. This is REALLY annoying."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Kept me on track and on time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I doesn't even remind me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Really I just want to know one thing. Why is there a way to install this on ""my other device"" witch is just like my device I'm on. Actually it's the exact device. Like I have two and the system and everything is the same. I mean. How does that even happen? Its installed already and now I can install it on a device that by my eyw, ia exactly the same phone. Like it has a twin . I just don't for the life of me understand this at all. Google is supposed to protect me. But instead it......"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Super Terbaik"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's a very good app for remembering things and also systematic way."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No option to import an existing task list. Not going back to square one. If you are beginning your first task list this app is worth checking out. Rated 1 star due the lack of import option."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"All things considered they seem to work okay. just trying to figure out how they can help me figure out my life agenda"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Easy to use, but you cannot ""snooze"" items and, instead, have to change the reminder time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Finally a Tasks app that is simple and easy to use. All it needs for five stars is if it had a companion watch app. Please let me use this on my wrist!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, I want more updates for it, designed too make you able too run through your daily, or up and coming random tasks and or things you just need too get done, maybe prioritizing things , with Google's ai and still like your own capability too edit the priorities if it's looking for keywords too say define priority and perhaps that could somehow come up with the wrong prioritization. Making it color coated for ppl too or at least the option going from -green, (easiest, possibly daily). >"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"really nice I can track my progress with this app using regular basis"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I wish it worked like an alarm. 90% of the time I don't notice the notifications"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Notifications are flaky and they removed the ability to snooze. Makes it useless for me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"does not get notification when a task is due"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love that it can integrate with everything!! I hope it keeps getting more features, but also it's simplicity is one of the best things about it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Sorry excuse for an app! Why doesn't flagged email automatically appear as a task? Needs integration with Microsoft todo, and ability to add pictures. Very very very basic. TOO BASIC TO BE USEFUL!! NEEDS MORE INTEGRATION WITH OTHER APPS SUCH AS FLAGGED EMAIL, TODO, PHOTOS, MUSIC, ETC."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app. If it had search I'd give it five stars. And why do you have to move overdue tasks one by one?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great experience"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Please correct your sending notification for reminders system or hire me. We can brainstorm together."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The only friction that I have with this app is that when I'm in the more-details view of any task, it takes two seconds before the screen updates and I'm in the view of list of tasks again. But there's no visual feedback whatsoever while this is happening, so I think my Back gesture didn't trigger and I do it twice and end up leaving the app. I'd also like to set location-based reminders like in Google Keep. Besides those, in terms of apps Google has made, this is one of their best. Least janky."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love this app helps get me focused"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great tools"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"untick all items (options is no more) please 🙏🥺 add option"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google Tasks is a fantastic tool for organizing and managing tasks efficiently. Its intuitive interface and integration with Google services make it very useful. Adding reminders based on location, Wi-Fi proximity, and phone calls would be a great improvement. This way, when you call or receive a call from a contact, Google Tasks could show a notification for the reminder associated with that person, enhancing user experience and task management. Thanks a lot."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"A single task (in a repeating series) should be able to be deleted when a task is open from the notification shade. Right now the only option is to delete all and I'm not sure this makes any sense. I usually only want to delete that one instance when I open that from the notification shade."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"don't get notifications"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's like having a personal planner on your phone. so convenient."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"idk..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Okay"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I use this app for its feature to sync with Google Calendar. I would love to have more customization in the lists, like labels in the calendar or color coding to differentiate between them."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"ADHD cheat code here"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome ❤"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Alright but could have way more filter options for viewing tasks like due today this week this month this year etc. Also could have way better subtasks functionality for more complex tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Why no watch app?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I would give it more stars if the repeating tasks I mark with a star would remain starred when they reoccur. There isn't a view (other than starred) where I can see all the things across all the lists that are coming up for today. It is very annoying to have to re-mark everything with a star every morning so it will show on my summary widget (starred)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"App is good but if I'm adding something that I'm supposed to do on Sunday then that task should not show on other days, at least in widget. Please Google, add this option as it can really help me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Cannot change task duration which is very inflexible not all task is 30 minutes some less some more"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Everything's perfect, just a suggestion for the widget: would be good to have a filter not only for the different labels or those highlighted but also those with close due dates. Thank you"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Earlier problems seem to have corrected. Shouldn't have been an issue in the first place. I don't really think about it much now cuz I don't use the app directly."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I keep getting logged out and couldn't click sign in. I had to uninstall and reinstall back just to sign in. It should be a simple, straight forward apps but why is it so unstable?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"My everyday go-to app for ALL my Reminders. One of my very fav keepers, as most days I'd be completely lost without it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Hopefully it does what every thing else can't"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Calendar/event/task mess"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is so easy to use and syncs between my laptop, tablet and phone so easily that I can stop using other apps and almost never need anything else to track progress about future plans."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"useful and easy to use ☆☆☆☆☆"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It's become very unreliable when it notifies me out events. 10, 20 minutes late, or not at all. Needs attention if I'm to rely on it. Hard to recommend at the moment."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Could be better."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's actually quite a good application. Simple to use, links to Google Calendar and other google apps. I would prefer to use a Google app for something simple like creating tasks rather than Microsoft Outlook or other task apps."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"cannot do search"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good apk"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I can't add Sub-tasks after setting a repeating task! Also, Sub-tasks remove repeating time. I want to do both Sub-tasks and Repeat! [Feature] I'd like to set time for each Sub-task! [Feature] Pinning tasks. I want to Pin some tasks. [Feature] I want two special Lists for Today & Tomorrow so any task that I add (in any list) that's set to these times will AUTOMATICALLY MOVE to these LISTS. Also adding reminders for missed tasks. I can also set a time for the reminder to when it should notifying."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like the simple and integrated nature of this app. It flows into my calendar so well, I use it for so many things now. But there are a few tweeks needed. Such as the ability within the app to only delete one occurrence, your can only do that with the calendar app and a family list, just like in the calendar would be great, not just list categories but shareable ones."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"good look for the app easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Could be easier?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Completely dissatisfied as no option to add alarm ⏰"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I must it is very helpful for students"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Since calendar reminders were replaced with the new Tasks app, I just do not get notifications for them on my Pixel phone. I've played with app and device settings but the app continues to nod do basically the only thing I need from it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Very poor app that does no more than list existing tasks in Google Calendar. When you add a new task it doesn't even offer date/time so it gets lost at the bottom of the list. Very poor. Uninstalled."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Everything was good until I tried to rearrange my tasks but I couldn't just because they were set to date. For example a task I set to repeat every week, every day or every two days (without a specific time of the day). I couldn't understand the wisdom from stripping us from such option. Yes I have set a certain task to be repeated but that doesn't mean I shouldn't be able to rearrange its order with other reoccurring tasks when the day comes. Checking off reoccurring tasks feels chaotic."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google is my favourite for backup and believe"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's good helps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great!"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's excellent. I love how it syncs automatically to my other google apps."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Imagine i was your family"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"when I say I think does it pay?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"it's not any more useful than writing a to do list, nothing innovative or special about it. it's cool when you can cross things off but even that is a bit unsatisfying because you click on a radial button and the line gets crossed off too fast and goes away a second later. bit pointless overall."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Keeps you on point"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's a great simple tasks app that doesn't try to do too much. You'll be able to use this app without directions and without practice, something that can't be said for all task apps. I have a couple of suggestions though: Ability to set priority level on a scale of 0-3 on tasks (and color options for priority levels), make it so that tapping on the tasks widget brings you to the tasks app, and it would be helpful if you could reorganize tasks from the widget"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Please add a search option,"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very good and friendly app. Now I do not miss a single timely action. It should have a non editable feature to show when was the task created, so that even though I edit date time, I am always aware when the task was created. Additionally, if the history of ""changed dates times"" is available, that will be helpful. Thanks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I thought this way of using tasks, versus Google Calendar, would offer more options, but no. Whether via this app or the calendar, my phone takes away my task notifications when it feels like it, which defeats the purpose of being reminded so you can actually get the tasks done. I thought I'd be able to control how long they show with this app. I'm not using Google for task reminders anymore. Enough is enough. I'm using a third-party app now."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very good, but can still be made colorful. If the app allows to customise color for different list, it would be great for visualisation in calendar. Having all tasks from different list (category) in same color is not much appealing in calendar app. Can google implement this feature? Thanks a lot."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"EDIT: improved rating after some improvements. This feels really un-googley. Its massively lacking in features - for example of a notification comes up to do something, you can't mark it as done, and then even when you tap and open on the app, you can't mark it as done, you have to go back to the list where it appears and then tick it as done. The UI is also too much on the 'bare' side. I like the fact that Google are doing a task app but it has a long way to go."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Limited and disappointing... There is no ability to search the tasks, and sometimes they show up, and sometimes they don't. Definitely disappointing in the overall user interface, as well as making sure repeating tasks are kept."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I just downloaded Google Tasks and created several routine tasks. I turned on notifications and set everything up properly, but later realized that it doesn't send notifications unless the application is open. I even gave it background power access, but still, I wasn't getting notifications when the application was closed. I'm not sure what the issue is with this application, so I uninstalled it, hoping that Google will see this and update their application."

I've deleted and reinstalled it, cleared cache, etc, and it will not send me notifications unless I open the app. This makes it completely useless.

I've evolved from using various sticky notes type apps, SimpleNote was another I used for a long time, but I think I was actually excited when I saw that Google did a lists app, and this is great. Very personalisable (?) As big or little as you want it to be Only complaint is I can't seem to reorder the lists in the app. Can on the laptop. But it meets my needs excellently."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Cartoonish. The general style of Google applications seems to be for toddlers and little way to change this. Overriding actual functionality."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"There is no ability to change the font and it's too small. It disables my calendar tasks reschedule function So if you don't care about your calendar and you see better than I do then this is probably a great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"very good for organising your day, month or even an year, but still has room for improvement."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Hope that there is a view of the all the tasks that is segregated in different list. The widget of the app is not effective as the layout is too loose. It needs to be more compact so that it's easier to glance through the list without entering the app. It will also be great if there is different colour labels like how the Google Keep."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"super useful ❤️🥰"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app has a lot of potential but needs a lot of improvement: Tasks completed reappear in the widget as pending, you can't search old tasks, can't open the app from the widget unless you enter the edition of a task. Its structure isn't as good and friendly as that of other important companies."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"If you're looking for a simple solution then this is it. I just really wish there was an option to create shared Tasks with other users in the App."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Subpar. New updates often ill thought out. Latest ordering of lists creates unreliable experience. ""My order"" no longer shows tasks with due dates on top, however, ""date"" order no longer shows subtasks, instead scattering them as regular tasks throughout list. Recurring tasks do not have a way to push remaining tasks forward (must edit each instance). Should have date editing option of ""this task, all future tasks, all tasks"", similar to events. Still no way to share tasks or lists."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Does not consistently send reminders. I've reinstalled that app, cleared caches, rearranged my Google accounts, ensured that battery and notification settings are correct. If I don't use the app for a week, and create a reminder using Google Assistant, the reminder notification doesn't come until I open the app. For me, that makes the app pretty useless, as I really only want it as a quick and easy way to set one-time reminders. Boggles my mind that this doesn't work on a pixel"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this app is absolutely amazing because you can make lists add an endless amount of tasks and there is NO ADDS! this app is by far the best app on my phone!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I like that it's integrated with the calendar, but the fact that recurring tasks don't appear once a single event is completed is asinine. Does not meet expectations and needs work."

You'll only get notifications sometimes when your phone is unlocked and screen is on, which makes it even more confusing as notifications are random."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Very basic client of Tasks. Doesn't allow to sort tasks alphabetically. Doesn't have search. It does sync and creation of lists and tasks, and that's all, so it's a very bare bones experience."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I would like to have the option of creating a subtask under one task AND be able to make the same task repeat for and not have to choose one or the other. Other than that, this app is very helpful. I find that the Microsoft ""To Do List"" is better for this reason."

People with ADHD have poor skills at estimating time for a specific task. I filled Task yesterday with tasks for today, that start at precise times. But because I can't estimate time I am late at first tasks and with the whole schedule behind, notifications useless. Suggestion is to add ""Delay all tasks for today by xx minutes"" button."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Sharing tasks with other google users is missing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Utterly useless app, I uninstalled it after less than 5 minutes because that's all I needed to explore everything the app can offer. You can do more things related to tasks on calendar than Tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"There is no way to specify when the reminded is needed directly on the description of the task (like on apple and samsung reminders). To pick the time, the app requires 4 steps each time, so using it for quick reminders is out of the question. Also there are zero settings to customize the experience."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Really like the app, it's neat and simple. I do certain things as daily routine and I found a feature missing that should be added i.e duplicate a task list otherwise I have to go again and untick all the completed tasks daily."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"No option to search tasks. Add a search bar to search tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Few issues I'm facing: - Sometimes the widget shows old data. There is no force refresh option. Even if I open the app by tapping on the widget, the data is not refreshing. I had to remove the existing widget and then add again. - Make reminder notification sticky with custom notification sounds options. - When an item is added it is expected to be added at the bottom. But this app adds items at the top. I have to reorder again. Require buttons in between each item to add an item directly there."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Can't attach images to tasks Can't set reminders for tasks Doesn't sync with Google calendar in any way Just pathetic. This is basic stuff we'd expect in 2024"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Hello Google developers ,you do remember you have an app called NOTES ,What's the significance of developing this app? why does tasks exist?

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"useful apps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It's not a reminder app. It's notifications are garbage and very very easy to miss"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Despite this being the best app to keep track of tasks, there is no way to change the notification sound to a longer tone. I would like to have that preference for some tasks. A simple notification won't do when i am not looking at my phone."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"there should be a sub tasks list to keep track of steps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's great! Just with the notifications could be louder and more pronounced so you notice them."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love taks application. it is simple and easy to use. I can arrange my notes without frustration."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The app is very basic and lacks the functionality to attach images and group lists."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like this app. it functions well. I wish it had the ability to share or assign tasks. Otherwise, it's a solid app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"no notification volume in app. have turned on in settings, still no volume in notification"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Project total timeline? All Projects in one list by date"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app, please add ""repeat task"" to the mobile app, and the ability to change the priority of the lists by rearrange them."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"a good choice for maintaining tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Basic but does the job. Sometimes there's a bug when creating a task: it will start repeating even tho I didn't ask it to."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Makes organizing life so much easier! It is nice how easy it is to quickly jot something down as it comes into you head with the push of a button. I just keep the app open and add things as they come up. Highly recommend."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It is very ok, but I think the reminder should pop up or there should be a ring tone for it. I probably don't know, but I like to know if all these features are within."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"l like it!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"App is great. I'll like to suggest that you put ""hour"" in the repeat."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I am happy with the app, but wish an extension was available to add to Google gemini so that it could create reminders for me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"could do so much better. more options for meticulous details bla bla bla"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great. it's great. simple."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Google tasks is one of the best to-do list apps around. It syncs with Google calendar or other Google Workspace apps quite well, but it has poor features. For example, it can not prioritize tasks and label them with a color code. Furthermore, there isn't a project section where you can share those project tasks with others collaboratively. Also, it doesn't have a habit tracker that you can track your reading, walking, or other activities."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Great and useful app, but even with the notifications set to 'on', the notifications have suddenly completely stopped so I can't see what tasks I've set or when they're due unless I open the app to check."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"1 hour push doesn't exist anymore on some phones. Most of my tasks are things for a general time frame so it would be nice to be able to push them off one hour rather than rearranging the whole thing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The widget should have an option to view today's tasks. Currently, the user can only view tasks by list. The app needs a general section to see the tasks that users have for the current day."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very good I like it good b working"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is great for helping you keep track of task and events that you need to complete or attend to."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Upsides Great integration with calendar, the only downside is that you can set a task start time but no end time, that way you can block off your calendar whenever you have a task to do Doesn't have a widget to pin on home screen."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Creating subtasks is a burden; you have to save the task, click on it, then create them. Would like to have the option to immediately start adding subtasks under the main one, similar to how it looks once you've created a task. Not a fan of this being separate from Calendar. Would be better if tasks listed in the order I made them, rather than last one on top, or at least have the option for that. Sucks dragging them around to get the order right. Overall a decent app, so far."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very practical"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Best to-do list app I've used. What would absolutely make this is being able to transfer tasks to other lists, and change the order of the lists themselves. Makes it kind of inconvenient Also it would be great if you could search through tasks in case you don't remember if you wrote it down and/or it was buried in the middle."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This has become my main go to tasks app! I love how it's also connected to my Google calendar I Wish there were any gamification elements added to it, like even a sounds when clicking tasks would be a great addition Imagine if Google adds EXP or Gcoins and in return of accumulation we can get access to let's say Google meet premium for a month ❤️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"easy app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good 🤞"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very simple and easy to use 👌"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Almost never works. Notifications never show, invalidating using tasks as reminders. I thought it was a setting, but no it's set up correctly. The old system was much more superior."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I'd like more options for scheduling tasks to include other people."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Notifications appear at totally the wrong times (most recent example was 12 hours late). And there is zero support available. The support email listed here doesn't work and the website it directs you to doesn't contain a relevant help article and doesn't allow you to speak to anyone about issues either."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I would definitely upgrade my ratings to 5 if one more option is added which is to make a task repeat ""every : hour & minutes"" in a day ! Please incorporate it 🙏🙏"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This app is very good to organise my tasks one place. But it's very silent, so when I complete a task, I don't feel any motivation. For that, I suggest Google to add sound effects, cool animation. Additionally, student uses this app to be organised too, like me! So you should create two types of workspace! When is for students and the other one is for official office workers. For the students you should make the app gamified so they can be motivated and inspired!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice App. In the contemporary whirlwind of quotidian exigencies and ceaseless commitments, Google Tasks emerges as a veritable paragon of organizational virtuosity. This digital maestro, with its seamless integration and intuitive design, orchestrates one's multifarious responsibilities with unparalleled efficacy."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Enlightening"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Is there a charge for this one or does this put on the calendar what your reminders should be"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"gud"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like the Google task calendar, because it's easy to mouniver around, with easy to choose dat and time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love this, friendly reminder application. Just what I need for daily reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's useful and effective. The only thing, I think, is missing, is the fact that it doesn't allow to reorganize the main list, the title list. It just stays in the same place as the first time I created it. And with time things change, so there should be an option to reorganize the main list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"ليش ما يدعم اضاة الصور😔"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good app for to do lists with great widget for easy use but not great integration with Google assistant it can't differentiate between lists notifications could be better but good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please add opacity and transparency to the widget, its the only thing that this lacks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Usual I will call u later"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Wish there was a wear os version"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Need to have a collaboration feature to share a list with others and they can edit as well and that will sync with there calendar to."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"thankyou ❤️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"pretty good app. some suggestions. 1. allow for a lot more customizations for both the app and widget. different colors, fonts etc. all other task apps have this. 2. Allow for recurring tasks to have subtasks. I don't understand why this isnt already a thing. just because a tasks has multiple sub tasks doesn't mean I don't want it repeated the next day. 3. make an option for CROSS OFF ALL ITEMS, UNCROSS ALL ITEMS. 4. allow for subtasks to be hidden for a cleaner look"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Could have a ""Search"" bar and tags. That way we could have a streamlined list of tasks that can be easily searched for by tags or text."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it could use more depth of features to link with calendar and alarms it feels like the integration with calendar got started and then just left. Otherwise it's fine, but just kind of shallow."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very easy to use, not overly complicated l, very simplistic and works wells for plotting my weekly agendas"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Simple enough task app, lets me link emails, would be nice if I could move tasks between lists, or if "" My Tasks "" was the same as my Gmail tasks. Due dates don't always notify me, and it would be nice to have the option for periodic reminders for overdue things"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"App never sends notifications even though I checked all of my settings. I'm constantly forgetting to do things because this app doesn't remind me which is the whole purpose of it. I expected better."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Hell lot of features missing. Im having to pay Todoist each month."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Does the job. I would like the option to hide upcoming tasks (like if I set it for a future date, i don't want to see it pop up until that date) and also change the default color of the time indicators, like make them green until they're overdue at which point they become red"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"there's so many of these out there, then there's the fact that Google made this one I'm just a little suspicious about my privacy data all that good stuff besides that though seems to work pretty well"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Please add a search feature, to help find existing tasks. I have many tasks across many lists, and a search feature would really help find the task I am looking for."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I wish there were tasks that could be triggered when you arrive at specific locations. sometimes I have the times wrong and a location triggered task would solve that"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Loved the app, hated the lack of integration with desktop, particularly macOS. Anyways I'm keep using it hoping for the feature to be released. If you mostly use mobile devices, I think is a perfect app, but it needs more desktop integration"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's a very good way of reminding you ,when you forget , because of all the things you have to do."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Absolute necessity. A must have"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Was a person who always wrote down ""what to do list"" when i was a lot younger in age (20-35 yrs). But since I reached my upper 40's I stopped and only remembered the little things that needed to do and this included important things. But with this app I now start writing what needs done and checking it off. I am really enjoying this app!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I will use my calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Pretty good for keeping track of chores n errands."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"notifications are silent often, I've tried re-enable, it works sometimes."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this app is very save time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"My reminders don't work right anymore they now come in a day to 2 days late or when they want to if they even come at all. This used to work awesome, especially for some of these people I help who have have memory problems. I have to find an app or use the Samsung calendar now unless they get this worked out. Lately every time something gets updated, it seems like we either lose something or something doesn't work right or gets moved around"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Feature request pleeeaaasee: 1. Add tasks to specific list via google assistant. 2. Option to make reminder notifications sticky and remove only when we click on any action button"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Lonely"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The app could use alarm or reminder system for the task in a given specific time.. if i add a task with specific time it reminded me at the end of the day whether I've completed or not which is useless at all. If it remind me 10 mins beforehand of the specific time it would be helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and effective— the perfect tasks app for me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Might be good for some, but if it doesn't have the option to set a recurring task that reschedules ""X days after last completion"", it's a non-starter for me. Uninstalled. E.G. ""water plants every 4 days."" What if you don't get to it until the 6th day? You don't need to water again in 2 more days. Should reset 4 days from when you complete it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It's nice that this app populates on Google calendar, but as a stand-alone app it doesn't show future recurring events ahead of time. A 2 week look ahead would be nice."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Tasks only trigger notifications 50% of the time. I set times for notifications for all of my task, but most are not sent."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app, covers everything to organise my life successfully. Recommend."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"PLEASE, LET US SHARE TASK LISTS WITH SOMEONE!! The app is trash unless you live alone in the world. It's only useful if you pretend to track only your personal tasks and routine. Also you can't even use it to set hourly recurrence, it sucks if you intend to use it to track a medicine routine for example. Other than that: DO NOT USE IT."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Amazing, i have ADHD and like seeing a number with the word ""completed"" next to it go up which is why i like video games so much. I like to write down goals in this app and then attempt to accomplish those goals ASAP to make number go up. This helps a lot with that affect because of the simple and easy to learn UI, i learned the ins and outs within a minute. 5 stars, highly reccomended"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"why can't I share lists?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"You're forced to have notifications enabled for every Google account connected. My partner is logged in on my device so she can access Find My Device as she loses her phone a lot. To have that, you need to be signed in, and when signed in I get Task notifications for her recurring Google Tasks. Getting false positive notifications twice daily renders the actual notifications I need useless. There's no way to change this setting. Very poor app development - there are multiple complaints online"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I like GTasks. I wish when you open the apps up(notes & tasks etc.) that all your notes, tasks would not be on the opening of the app. Adding this I think would be a very appropriated feature. A cluster of your tasks at the opening is not. Why I'm always looking for this particular feature along with fonts, colors among some."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I live off of Google Tasks. It's so useful. I have several lists set up, one for my every day tasks I need to do, then others for specific fields of things I'm working through. The integration with things like Google Assistant is where it's at. Just asking my watch, phone or Google Nest to ""remind me to do something at 3pm tomorrow"" not only adds it to Google Tasks, it sets a reminder for the appropriate time. And you can do the same thing for repeated reminders. Life changing."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Pretty cool for managing your tasks in a quick, simple, and efficient manner. It would help if there were features involving a bulk of tasks to be selected for deletion or completion, as well as automatic timestamping. Overall though, decent application with remote saving capabilities for access across multiple devices with the same user account. Strongly recommend for schedule management and even note taking"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Very bad, worst ever"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Op"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I'm sort of new to this app but so far I like it. I had to move on to something else after I realized Google Keep would only let me carry 50 files."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great, helps me keep track of my day!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent 👌"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"can't share tasks. might as well use Google keep"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Does not work. Will not remind you of anything until you open the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this is great very easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"convenient way to be reminded of things to do"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"so good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I wish the app had at least some good features to integrate with calendar. I wish I could replace todoist with this but. Google tasks can't hold a candle for even the todoist free plan. Seems like this project is discontinued 😕"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"What is this?????"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good app 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Helpful!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"continued incremental changes make this a nice, functional - if basic - task list. I like how it integrates with Calendar as well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Please add a dark theme option .."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It is very easy and good to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"no way to edit or delete tasks. it says task removed but will reappear on the next scheduled day but I don't want it to. i want it deleted, gone, history."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So far so good."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easily complete the things I have to do Add to calendar easily"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"tasks are amazing for keeping track of all the different lists that you might have."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminders do not notify or even show up. Functionality is broken on a fundamental level. Would give zero if possible"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"so helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Nearly perfect, but I would like to be able to nest more than one level."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Overall, a great tasks app. One thing I would really like to be added is an option for recurring tasks to appear with the next instance after completing the current one. Pls add 🙏"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very needful application in todays lifestyle"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Просто. Удобно. Практично."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Now you don't get any notification for your tasks. Earlier this feature was with Calendar app which made sense because calendar is used to decide tasks and events but this separation is in the wrong direction. Thankfully Microsoft has better app for this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"This app should have an inbuilt search bar to make keywords based searching easier."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"to usee frinedly and not proper reminder user friendly dash board"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I never, ever get my reminders on time. Multiple morning reminders come at late night altogether and so. Have been using reminders for years now, has been so helpful but lately, the past few months, it has been absolutely useless. Pls do something about it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"No WatchOS app + if Google Keep had calenders integration for lists... This app would be instantly obsolete"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"“I utilize this app to meticulously track all my tasks, no matter how small. Whether it’s a fleeting thought or a significant to-do, it finds a place here. Tasks can be added w/ voice input, and remain on the list indefinitely until marked as complete. As far as Gemini is concerned, the Gemini integration occasionally adds tasks, bbuit’st not consistently reliable..... Yet."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Often doesn't send notifications"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love that this app helps me keep track of birthdays, appointments, taking my medications, favorite TV shows, even making shopping lists, etc. I'd be lost without it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I use to use Calendar for tasks, but they could 'expire' incomplete and get lost. But Tasks keeps incomplete tasks before you; just what you want."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Repeating tasks being hidden caused an issue where I thought I had deleted a task and yet I kept getting reminders and I couldn't find it to delete it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Yes! You can now rearrange order of lists in the app! Thanks Google, please keep it going 😉 /// Still no reordering of lists or search function. Such basics. Shame. And when a task is set as recurring it's blocked from moving to other list..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great tool!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Use the app regularly, love it, thank you, BUT, I am writing this review to kindly ask the developers make a little change. At the moment users can't create tasks that are reoccurring and have subtasks. Please change this, thank you!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice and simple task list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"it doesn't remind me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"One of the best Application in Play Store 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app to organize your life! making a task is simple and there are no unnecessary button presses so plus points for that. The only thing I miss is being able to share a list with other people to make sharing the tasks easier!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Nice app but lacking features. should have the ability to create tasks with natural language that inputs date and time by typing. Would benefit from different task views like board. Features are behind what is offered in other apps. This app could be amazing but it feels like an afterthought, and no one is focusing on evolving it. If you enjoy a simplistic app, this is amazing. I just wish it had more features."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Prior to the Tasks app, my reminders notified me. After switching to Tasks app, I am not being notified of reminders and am now missing important reminders. I've confirmed all notification settings are on for Tasks, Calendar, etc. SOLUTION/UPDATE: Go into Tasks ""App Info""/Settings, Notifications, Notification Categories, select each individually below, turn ON ""Show as pop-up"". You also need to unselect ""Pause app activity if unused"" within ""App Permissions""."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"superb.... well organised"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This now has Google Assistant integration."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is great!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it is nearly a complete app. Leaving some space just for improvement 😁."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Such a good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No complete list view, with list filters and date filters (this week, this month, all). UI is terrible. This is a subpar app. Can't even share lists, or create a family task list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I rely on notifications to remember specific tasks, but they disappear after each update (which occur annoyingly frequently) and after rebooting."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I was used to Google keep and todoist. this app covers my basic needs from both apps. it is a great tool to use throughout the day to take a quick note so you can be reminded later to complete the task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A great app for staying organized. One feature I would like to see is the ability to sort the tasks by day and also drag them into a specific order within that day. If you add a time for the task, then the app will organize the tasks based on the timing. However, I don't always have a specific time to do tasks but there are instances when I want to do one before the other."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and quick. Great for a short reminder."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simples e funcional."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"really convenient, especially when you use the widget on the home screen 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"10/30/20 Overall, this is a very helpful app! I am about to try the desktop version (an extension on Google Chrome) to see if I like it as well. 03/04/23 All of sudden, I think due to the newest update, I am not able to get to the tasks screen. It keeps saying ""Unknown server error."" Please let me know what I should do or when this is fixed, as I heavily rely on this app to save links and tasks. Update 3/27/24: I was able to access my tasks again! I'd love for there to be a way to search tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"best app for reminding our goals"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"They have really improved this app, the integration with Google environment is also great"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it's very simple and easy using I love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I do a lot within the Google ecosystem, and I would like to love this app. But two things are dealbreakers for me. (1) Sound does not work for notifications on my Pixel 8 Pro. I've researched this issue online (particularly in Google forums and on Reddit), and others are having the same issue, but there is no solution. There's not any apparent response/acknowledgment from Google. I've made sure that I don't have restricted battery usage for the app or such. (2) There's not a search feature."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"cannot share the notes like via email or d cannot find this option easily"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Not hD a problem to date"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Top top"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"A search bar for tasks is needed, also we need to be able to schedule a task hourly. Everything else is pretty good."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I want to be reminded hourly, I cannot do that. I can do that with Samsung reminders much better and much powerful app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Wouldn't know what I do without it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"awesome need to add alarm system"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Consistently inconsistent reminders. Through many updates, force stops, and phone reboots, this app consistently sends reminders at the wrong time. I set a reminder for 7:35pm last night, went to bed and woke up at 8am to find a notification ""6 hours ago"" for my (by then) long-overdue task. This behavior is persistent to the point of rendering the app useless. Jesus christ Tasks, you had one job."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"When you complete a task that is set to repeat, no new task is being created. Completing it will complete the whole series. My expectation is that when you complete a recurring task, it will only mark the current task as complete and a new task will be created automatically with the next due date. I will shift back to microsoft ""to do""."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Bring the app to Chromecast with Google TV 4K please."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"so much easier then I thought idk why I took so long to get on board using a million other apps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Garbage app doesn't even bother doing the one thing it's supposed to (i.e. give reminders)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent. Stay on the edge of your tasks!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I have tested this several times. Reminders to the assistant appears in tasks, but I am not reminded. Google, please fix this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Its a very good app until the time i realised that i cant move tasks which are on repeat. I just started to love the app and boom when i wanted to segregate my long list into two different list, heartbreak coz i will have to type it all in :( Hope someone fixes this (fingers crossed)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"does what it says but doesn't help with my produktivity."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"See 🙈 my old Google pictures accounts back up everything from years ago ☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"my reminders are about 5 minutes late now after I downloaded this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It needs its own alarm Remind me at the beginning of the day. That way, if something changes, I will have sufficient time to cancel."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it makes things easier , great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like the Keep check boxes more than the radio dial selector for each task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"GREAT APP FOR ORGANISING TASKS AND BEING PRODUCTIVE BUT SOME FEATURES CAN BE ADDED LIKE DELETING MULTIPLE TASKS AT A TIME AND SOME MORE......BTW Great 👍🏻"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's just so easy to keep track of anything. Love it, thank you"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"As an MBA student this is a very productive application for students like me, am really thankful to Google for this"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Sorry boy's"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Widget is completely messed up. It isn't synchronized. Checking items off or switching lists doesn't seem to do anything"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Why I don't get notified ? Reminder or task I'm not notified 😐"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helps me keep track of things and is a cinch to use with google assistant on my Pixel 8 pro."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Rajib chandra biswas"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"05/22/2024 wish it was aesthetically pleasing. Maybe add some background like grid line like in a notebook or dotted lines, or more font, color, icon options to do more aesthetic tasks especially for me that I'm ADHD and certain visuals help me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's a life saver for me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this app, it's a lifesaver, especially when you have ADHD! I have only one little gripe: I use the widget, and it doesn't let me look at my list unless I press the + button for a new task, or select a task that has already been created; this puts me in full screen edit mode. But usually, I just want to see what I have on my day-to-do list, which doesn't fit into one widget screen. So I'd really like to just be able to touch the widget somewhere, to just *view* the prominent list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome 👍🏻♥️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please allow both ascending and decending!!! I usually add task starting from the first task I need to do."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Now Google Assistant reminders show up hours after scheduled, under tasks. Thanks, now reminders are pretty much useless. People with ADHD prefer reminders to stay focused, not a list of tasks to perform."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent, essential daily use app for work and personal. Great integration and custom reminder times. Has a lot of potential to expand even further and offer more features"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Great for making a list but wish the task list could appear in notification bar so it can be seen when notifications is pulled down on screen."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Not exactly where I need to be .. just want regular tv ,& movies .. Can't remember name of ON DEMAND movie channel."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"While calender gives snooze/reschedule option in notification, why the Google tasks doesn't do? please add snooze option in notifications."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The ONLY reason I gave Google Tasks only one Star is because THERE IS NO SEARCH!!! How ironic that the most popular Search engine in the world doesn't have a way to search Tasks 😡 I also would like Google to offer a way to lock my Tasks. Other than that, I think Google Tasks plays a very important role. I have already shared this feedback with Google... as have MANY others!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Thanks for this excellent app. Can you please add feature to move/reposition the task lists? And a feature to move a task from one list to another?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"A very useful checklist. 4/5 because the mobile widget can be a little bit of a pain, but overall very useful for forgetful types like myself."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Might as well use a notepad"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Worst app i m not able to add tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Back up task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"fantastic"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"tha ks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The app is amazing but I think it needs a ""Today"" tab for all the tasks at that day"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great, though would like to move tasks from one list to another without retyping it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very helpful for task management, I found it very nice 👍."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Not really used it other than to store my things to do that ill not be doing."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Bare bones, needs extra features. Needs to be updated to feature parody Samsung Reminders. Please add: Full screen reminders, location based remembers via Google assistant, 15 min snooze option, wear OS alerts and app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"can't use service unless have the internet service or connected to wifi all depending on provider roghr? I can't use this feature all the time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"On 19.05.2024 Please we should be able to copy the entire work list to pest it in some other app**Neither U R replying Nor Implementing.**On 13.06.2022 Nothing herd about my remark of 04.12.2020*On 04.12.2020 It's a beautiful app. It will be still better, If we could transfer (Share or forward) to other users. For example, I have prepaired a list of medicines, which I should be able to transfer it to my chemist."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"simple app wish there were a little more features and ways to organize tasks/ sub tasks and schedule them"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"it's ok, the only problem is that i need a separate app now for task, while calendar had perfectly good Reminders! They are also not grouped in the calendar widget so the calendar is crowded. It will show all upcoming tasks even if they are not yet to be completed. For example the task is on WED and today is MON. It will show you a task to complete..... Calendar had perfectly lovely and most useful Reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I wish I had this app growing up! can't tell you how much I would have understood what my mother and father were going through 😞 and the legacy of 16 aunts and uncles..7 brothers and sisters You guys are an an Absolute breakthrough to science!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"App works great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this is pretty good 🔥🔥"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"You can't share lists. That's huge. I'll use MS To-Do for now."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I would like to be able to add subtasks to recurring tasks. At this point, I am unable to. Other than this, I like this tool!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good app, you can set tasks with Google assistant, they appear on your calendar and it works fine. I like the minimalist appearance of the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I can't seem to make tasks & subtasks recurring on my phone"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Please Add Search Button to Search Tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works as promised"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Doesn't rollover repeat tasks if that instance is unfinished when the next repeat is set to occur. For example if I have an assignment set to do one a day M-F and miss Mondays, it just disappears when Tuesdays instance starts. It also doesn't have a way to show all tasks from each list at once in app unless you manually star each one and change view to starred. These are basic features any task app should have."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I'm giving this app a 3-star rating currently, because I just downloaded it & haven't been using this app long. Once I have used this app for a while I'll update my rating."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Yes it is a good number. A few times I wasn't sure if she was still on phone. She said she was working on it. Told her later I had to go and asked if she would get back with me regarding outcome."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please add bulk editing for tasks date. Or allow drag and drop to modify the date when the list is sorted by date...would be much more easy to use. Thanks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Most useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"tasks are extremely helpful for keeping track of different things"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"When I add a task and make it repeat daily, and the next day comes without completing today’s task, the task disappears and only the task for the next day appears. I want a solution to make the missed tasks that are repeated daily disappear."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't actually remind me of tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like the app, but it still needs some improvement. My biggest complaint is that you have no control over the length of tasks. Some tasks take 15 minutes while others take hours. It's hard to look at my calendar to see if I'm free and then have to recall from memory how long each task will take. It would also be helpful if subtasks could be scheduled. That would help me break up projects more easily. Overall, the app is working for me now, but I may need more features in the future."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"no alert went off after I asked for a reminder"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Nicely done, only one major fault, the alarm ping is silent if your phone's sound is off. Yes, some task apps will play a loud sound even if you've turned the sound down or off. I am using one of them. Not fair to Google to mention the name."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Dog water app. Much much worse than the reminder system it replaces as this constantly fails to remind me. Go back to calender reminders which worked...."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"If they would add better support for the pixel watches, it'd be 5/5 Love the app other than that"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good, should be mapped to calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Okay to have"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"makes keeping up easier"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This is so unnecessarily cumbersome."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Forgotten about you 😜 the same email ✉️ oi oi to get the time I will in E regards to get r the inbox 📥📥📥😁😁 the inbox 🙂"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Disclaimer: haven't actually used it at all. Literally just downloaded it. Auto-voting bc the last umpteen apps from Google, LLC were five stars too so it seems irrational to assume anything else."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"thankya"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"pros: A great simple app for tasks and reminder , sync with google calendar. option to make subtasks, multiple lists, reminder for each subtask, con: one thing that should be improved ,if a list is deleted(accidentally), there is no way recover it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app lots of options!!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is very good for organizing tasks, especially when you're a forgetful person like me! 😅"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The widget doesn't update after sometime"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"More functions like collaborators would be nice. Why can't I search within my tasks. Notification icon looks too similar to WhatsApp icon! Edit: I can't click on a task anymore to edit or reschedule it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The app is good but it doesn't allow us to create a repeating task consisting of sub tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Horrible now. I used to be able to rely on this app to help me remember things, but now it only reminds me half the time of half my tasks. A lot of the time I get the reminder on the NEXT DAY. That's completely useless. Fix please. It used to be so good. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, gave proper permissions. It's not me, it's the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple, effective and works really well on desktop and mobile"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It shows server error and deletes all my data"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Usual Google half baked release. , can't understand why this exists as well as keep and a lackluster reminders which has no dedicated app cand can't see neither with emails. Can't add images and attachments to a task. Even links don't hyperlink themselves! Confusing mess of apps from Google once again. SORT IT OUT! Update: years after release and they've added taks in the ""share to"" sheet... 1 what took so long? 2. Still can't share images etc in to tasks. Utterly useless. No search even!?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"idk if task can be connected with notion since it's under google llc"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"yes , I notice this app last year and Started doing it since and now a days i found it very interesting ❤️ so again tnx to Google"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Only problem is that it not add multiple tasks at once"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent, bare bones app for managing my to do list. It could have more functionality but I have all the elements I need."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"needs better customization on list alarms, widgets, Google watch tile improvement, timers attached to tasks needed, mid app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing. I'm finally being more productive, focused, and organized. I love that I can create various categories, set tasks to repeat when necessary, and that it syncs with Google Calendar. Wish I'd started using this app ages ago."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Simple and straightforward. it would be nice to see a list of all recurring tasks though. I haven't checked for a long time so maybe it has changed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"more"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Valuable- The ability to simply add, remove, and edit tasks and lists, home screen widget, also designating subtasks couldn't be more convenient. Those features meet most of my needs but improvements to the current app I could use would be the ability to clear recurring or date/time info from existing tasks, and the ability to share lists with contacts for collaboration on shared tasks. Additionally syncing the list with my Google calendar, and the ability to make tasks with subtasks recurring."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I haven't been able to discover a way to search my tasks. I don't understand how Google could fail to provide such a fundamental capability."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good like"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"👍👍👍👍👍👍👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Dont show notifications of the reminders. Often show reminders after one day."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, simple UI, light and fast"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I'm usually creating tasks through Google Calendar app and Google Tasks app only caused the notification of tasks (that created with Calendar) to randomly not work. So I deleted this app and now it works again. How come they don't work together?"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"the three dots that let you move tasks keep moving. then I need a table format that I can do in tasks for meal planning."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"doesn't notify me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Has helped me to be more organized with my ideas, for someone who might distract easily with a bunch of thoughts, having this app could be truly helpful when adding the right tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It’s a great app for time management. If the completed task are shown the time when it has been compled it will be better."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is simple & smooth! ... just like the women I like. 🫠 jk, but seriously. lol"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It is an awesome app. but the downside is it doesn't has natural language processing feature."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not interested"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"thankyou all of you ."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"bagus, tampilannya simpel"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is what I needed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I would love if there was a Pixel Watch option for this task app. You can see your tasks in calendar on the Pixel Watch which is ok. But it'd be nice to be able to go into the task app itself on the watch and choose different categories, make new tasks and stuff."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The old reminders were better... Don't think I've been reminded of a single task, or appointment in an adequate amount of time... I'm uninstalling in favor of literally any other app because I just got a task notification 45 minutes AFTER my appointment, and this is my last straw"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Too many apps to tend to tasks that uses different languages and directions to follow. My brain is no computer. Sorry. In fact my vocabulary is limited in the English language."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Simply doesn't work. Recurring task dates routinely change themselves or tasks don't ""reset"" for the next scheduled occurrence. I use it to set bill reminders and I'll set up name, date, and set recurrence for 1 month. Then when I pay them, I click the ""completed"" button so they aren't in the way. But I'll look later and see that the next occurrence is like SIX MONTHS away, not 1 month as it should be."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like how dated tasks show up on the calendar. Easy to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Have been using Google tasks 4 - 6 months. Love how it integrates with my calendar and sends out reminder notices. No advertisements, this app is great 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"There should be a ""All"" labelled column that shows all tasks from all the lists. I dont want to use star for every tasks, she that they appear on the first column. And please add due date."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"ever since task were required and the only option, the calendar is late to remind. sometimes by an hour, mostly by one full day, a few one month late reminders. google creates a functional app, then breaks it later down the road."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I tend to be an unorganized individual, but since downloading Tasks I am on top of my new organizational skills. Thank you Tasks!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Task app is very good I have used it off and on and it helps with daily routines"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Needs some work to do. I do my routine in Google Keep with checkboxes, and I've tried to send the tasks here, but got an unexpected result. Please fix this! One year later, still the same."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is a good productivity app for teenagers as well as who works in a private sector. Every morning I starts with making of tasks for the day. And it helps me a lot to cover my daily unproductive tasks. And I hope you will add some more features. Thank-you 🙏"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome Experience"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It’s very good app. It help me for my study, work."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Tasks have come a long way! It now integrates with calendar, tasks can be added via assistant (""remind me to..."") and I can sync (to emacs, in my case) via the API."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Another great application from Microsoft!!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good & Useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"great useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's pretty good to help me stay organized."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and set up follow-ups"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"App is useful, But most of the I missed my scheduled task because there is no alarming features in the app, so please add an alarm feature because only notification is not enough."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Would like to see the option of adding different priorities (or colours) to my tasks. Unfortunately the widget rarely updates itself."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great program"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love this with out my phone I would not ve able to keep in track of everything events appointment I need to save reminders .. my samsung watch my health and therapy sessions I get my goals met 😊"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"fun to use in conjunction with calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very useful app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Worst to do app ever"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent. Really most convenient, across multiple platforms. Very flexible."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Observing others in there bad deeds n low life attivites"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great App for doing everyday tasks. Really increases your ability to get that To-Do-List attitude going!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So efficient app to optimise your goals"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this app is a great help to me running a busy farm,it's used daily 🙂"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Can we please provide an option to sort tasks and lists alphabetically?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Add search option for searching notes and text."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Wish it was more colorful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Pretty good reminder tool for recurring tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Terrible recurring tasks feature! You create a recurring task, you finish it, mark it complete, but the repeated task disappears from your tasks list but shows up on calendar! Absolutely asinine! Who would design something like this! Was so excited about this app till none of my recurring tasks are showing up after the first instance."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Super nifty app for making task lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helps me. I'm still getting use to it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I can't even call Google Tasks barebones, because it'd need at least a skeleton of a functional usable tasks app, and it ain't got that. And as an added feature integrated into GCalendar it's incredibly lacking. No way to assign different colors to different task lists (i.e. for home, work, etc), or otherwise visually separate task lists in calendar on mobile at all. Can't share task lists, even as a simplest RSS to integrate into other people's calendars."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"First, the widget is too big (3*3). It should be the same size as the calendars widget (2*3) so both of them could be placed side by side on the same screen. Second, there's no snooze button in the tasks notification. Shame."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I cannot install in my Techno Neo Pova 5. I don't know Whats the issue. Installation error. Always"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Need to improve as user friendly"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Probably the most useful I've found. Too many try to be overly complex. Keep it simple, let me tap to complete, don't go away until I tap it. Easy. I wish for 1 feature, don't show my subtasks in the bottom of the list with ""no date"". Thanks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"keeps me organized as a working mom"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it helps my ever spiraling mind"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Bad ui, learn from tick tick app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Better after adding the kanban style. You need to add two more things: different color code for different tasks list and the possibility to select all lists on the widget off the app (all tasks to be shown under the same display widget, no matter to which list they belong to)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great tool to remind me of daily tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very nice Love it👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"this app is horrible"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I find this application very useful, an excellent complement for managing my time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This application has been incredibly helpful in reminding me to take my antibiotics on time. I am very grateful for this app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"My daily work tool that helps me with tasks management and reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"works best for me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"the best ever"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Pleàsed I'm"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I needed an app where I could quickly list the 17,000 things people would ask me to do creatively so I could choose what to focus on. Many were deeply un urgent and would have no time scale so I would struggle with specifics. Having a space to just list what each thing was, helped me to create further lists with each of the actions."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"add dates and habit menu"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Notification issue for timed task, after Android 11 Update."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love using this app. saves me from forgetting tasks, just wish the widget had the option to be transparent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminders are not reminding. The 1 feature of this app is broken."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"This is a serious concern. Please provide us a feature to see today's tasks and pending tasks in the widget. It is difficult to figure out quickly the tasks for today and upcoming tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"the app is ok for what i need it to do"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great and easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good, but strange that the mighty Google can't make an even better app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A++"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Bechari betiyan Gamgeen betiyan"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love it!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The interface doesn't look very good, but the functionality is spot on."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Does not indicate overdue daily routine tasks, just overwrites them. I cannot mark the task from the day before as completed because it's overwritten. I recommend creating a separate space in the list view for overdue tasks for people like me that are particular about completing and documentating tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"GOOGLE I BEG YOU DO NOT KILL THIS APP It should be maintained and is very helpful in my day to day tasks in work and in life. Don't send this to the infamous graveyard. Please and thank you!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I use this regularly as a way to remind myself of little things throughout the day. For the past few months, the app does not 100% succeed at reminding me. For example, I'll say: ""Hey google, remind me to get my lunch from the fridge at 3:20 pm. "" The app registers what I say, and the reminder goes in tasks. But when 3:20 rolls around, I receive no notification at all. It's about a 50/50 chance if it works or not. Then I remember days later. This doesnt fly as a reminder app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works. simple. efficient."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is AWESOME. The widget feature is best part about this app. Makes creating tasks on the fly SUPER easy and quick."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very Helpful Apps, Thanks Google."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it's alright"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminders don't happen until hours after the specified time. ""Remind me in 20 minutes.."" - reminder pops up 6 hours later."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Fast & convenient to create, change & tick off tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"works well"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Annoying as no search button provided. Really needed a search button."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Google has the worst designed and bungled task and reminder and calendar system ever created. Any alternative of superior to this junk Google cobbled together from old leftovers. Stay far away from Google."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This app design wise, isn't finished. Lol It's ugly. But it's highly functional. I think the only thing missing is the ability to create subtasks. Love the Google Calendar integration. Keep updating team. Good job 👏"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Could do with some more customisation options for colour coding, pictures, drawing ect but overall a good task organising app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Lists I made disappeared."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very collaborative and gives a recreational vibe to daily tasks. MY phone is always pinned with the beautiful sticky-notes like perception & notifications."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Sehr gut"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Pretty sure it's the best option for a long and successful candidate who has the right amount of the best thing to do with a long and successful in order for the little guy with the best option for your muffin tins of Red bull and toung fu fix 💎👅"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Well I hope you a good Google tasks give it a try"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Unsure At this time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is very good. I can almost call it an essential, daily tool."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Extremely confused while using this. Compels me to check how to add, modify, delete entries."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Please make it that tasks can be typed directly in the list, like the web version. And also that they can be moved to another list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this app that's all"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very helpful to get organized with your time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple , elegant"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"if sound alongwith reminder that would be more better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps me remember stuffgf"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Desc"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Could be improved by a whole host of features 1. Ability for Google Assistant to pick a random task for me to do 2. Ability to put the list mode into compact view 3. Ability to search my list for the item I need to check off"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Ever since Google Assistant 'reminders' were integrated into the Tasks app, reminder notifications have been terrible. Most notably, notifications periodically do not pop up at all, nor at the specified time for reminders. Additionally, notifications don't reoccur if they were missed at the set time, even when not marked as completed - if phone notifications get cleared, either via phone reset or other means, it disappears and doesn't retrigger. Rec: Pls add option to repeat noti(s) until ✓"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"need improvise"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it's good. I can keep my work actively tracked and keep finishing it. 😊"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Would like recurring tasks to stay visible after completing, rather than only appearing on the day they are next due."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great for lists(tasks). But if you make subtasks, then you accidentally check the header instead of opening it, then you can't just go back and restore the header from the trash with all sub tasks. You also have to find each subtask, if you can remember."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"really good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Has been super useful in getting organized and getting things done as a college student! have to give 4 stars for 2 reasons: there's no in-app equivalent to the ""Boards"" feature on desktop which allows you to separate lists into topics. All of the lists are just thrown together, even in drop-down menus which is annoying when you have a lot of lists. Reason 2: The homescreen widget to view your tasks isn't very adjustable. Otherwise awesome tool!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Neat looking app and good integration with calendar. However, some basic functions missing. I just swapped over from Apple Reminders and I have to say the experience is not great. There is no today feature. This is pretty basic stuff. I just want to be able to see what I have due today without cycling through my lists. Pretty sure google could knock this over in a week of they wanted to. Also no collaboration. This means if I want a collaborative list I need to use notes seperately. Bit dumb."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app, love it!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good app for tracking my stuffs"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Hmm I can keeping"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Marking reoccurring task complete does not auto populate next occurrence, have to delete completed task first."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple but hits all the key features"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"sometimes doesn't even remind"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is really really helpful. It is a must to everyone who wants to keep their day organised and perform with peak productivity!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"A few suggestions : 1. Subtasks should by default get the same time as the parent task. When i sort by date, the sub tasks just stay at the bottom, dateless 2. Please make it so that photos or audio can be added to tasks. Makes it easier to record 3. Please introduce a feature to rearrange subtasks (just like how can rearrange parent tasks), it makes it really frustrating to have to rename a task instead of just rearrange it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Not bad but meh at best for a task app, outdated & feature less. wish google would put more effort into the task app. I also wish for more implementations of tasks into other Google apps/sites"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"More could be done to enhance this app. It is very plain and it would be nice to see some customization options for your tasks made available in the future."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Large delay"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I need some new feature and update"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Recurring task notifications disappear without being marked as completed after modnight"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"really cool app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good app but I think it's missing : - due date/time for subtasks - can't attach an image or audio as part of subtask"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Oil 905 in"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"this app doesn't have select all"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very helpful especially when in a hurry and trying to quickly make a note or reminder"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nothing special to say about it other than it works exactly as expected"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I just don't get the calendar reminders like I need to. I can't ask the assistant to make reminders anymore. they really ha e broken reminders with Google Assistant."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Hey guys. I wish you a good mood. Like to my commen and follow me. Video is ok. Привет чел. Желаю вам хорошего настроения. Ставь лайк моему коменту и подписывайся. Видео окей."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Notifications just don't work half the time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Retirement options"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it helps to organize my day"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"This application is good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like it, but please do a widget option so we can access it from our displays more easily. Thanks in advance."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I never used it before but i think its app would love to try it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Very unfriendly, hard to reschedule. There should at least be a default selection to quickly change the reminder to 1 or 2 hours, etc."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"widget doesn't update, app too simple"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It istoo easy to delete tasks or entire bins of tasks with no ""are you sure"" prompt or undo feature. If your task was a reminder to do something important like pay a bill or take medication, you better have backup reminders in place. Also how is it 2024 and this app can do location based reminders? There are not many things that Apple is legitimately beating Android at, but the reminder ""tasks"" app is certainly one of the most feature light ""beta release"" experiences from Google. Disappointing."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Works fine but I wish it would integrate with Google calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Can,t remove old tasks unless you change your email and phone number or in other words open a whole new google account."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This may seem like a completely redundant app for most people, but it really helps me organize in a crunch time or a list of people I need to touch base with."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Use it all the time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"just perfect"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"we need attachment feature for tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Nice overall, it would be useful if we could search for checked jobs in order to uncheck them again, eg for a shopping list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good application for me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Goes well with Gmail 😃"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"goooooooooooooood"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good apps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Can't figure out how to read my tasks can't see what the task is .Very difficult"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I like it's simplicity but would appreciate being able to see completed tasks (scored out)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it certainly helps me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"A very good one 1. Reminder works well ( it's give you notification on right time 2. It's completely FREE 3. One can set any reminder on daily , weekly,or any day in month or year basis 4. Time setting cool 5. One can add description 5. Works offline ( some features maybe not available offline) Etc. Overall GREAT, my request is pls add some THEME..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love it"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy to use, useful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"does what I need and does it well"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"thanks for the help with my cash flow 😁"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Rápida de usar (muy optimizada, responde muy rápido) y con excelentes defaults. De las mejores apps de tareas que he probado. Me gustaría que tuviera 2 características: 1) opción de buscar 2) que las subtareas en lugar de desaparecer al ser completadas, fueran simplemente tachadas y enviadas al fondo, ya que las subtareas sirven como contexto de la tarea principal y al desaparecer se pierde el contexto."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Outstanding"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"it's a great concept, but the functionality is not good for me. push notifications of reminders are very unreliable."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Works well, but lacks features. Quite a lot of features are lacking in Google Tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice work"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It eases my tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The app is great but I wish the app would have a full screen notification instead of just a pop up at your notification bar reminding you of your task to be done. It's easy to miss the reminder set."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"You should make it more similar to that of iPhones. That is more user friendly."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this is the best list to record, rescheduled and remember work from ... thanks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Needs a search function; needs to allow you to find out when the task was completed like remindersv used to."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I really like this app. I think it also goes really well with Google calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"you the best"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good application for tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Sir, I am pleased with your descriptive statistics as well as guidelines for people. Thanks. 2.Please always keep contact with me. I also talked in my friend circle about your Precious MSGs."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"When I miss a task set for a specific time, if I complete the task after midnight, the task no longer appears on Google Tasks in the list of incomplete tasks for the day. It moves the task to the next scheduled time, so I must open Google Calendar and mark the task as completed using that app instead. Otherwise, it'll mark the task completed for the next scheduled time, throwing off my list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I'm fine this app very interesting."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I really like the tasks feature in calendar, it's very helpful to remind me everyday of things I need to get done without having to set an event."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good application, useful and optimised"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Hi google LLC 🖐🏼 I'm here to request you for a feature that is very much needed in tasks. I always feel this feature is missing in tasks application. Pls add more repeat occurrences in repeat section like minute and hour based that will make the tasks get done easily by continuos reminders. I believe that you consider my request and make this possible."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Great app overall but the widgets don't auto update when a new day starts. So if you have checked everything off it will stay empty till you manually reload it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy to use , very practical. Also can be used for notes, paragraphs , ideas and as a cheat sheet."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I llike using the Google Task app help to keep my minal tasks organized"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"👌"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It's not sending me reminders or notifications. They all pop up only when tasks app is opened. All notifications switched on. It's getting very frustrating"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"consistent reminders the day after events"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"A ideia da aplicação é boa, mas poderia ser mais útil. Ao incluir uma task com horário, deveria haver uma notificação quando esse horário chegasse, ou a opção de ser notificado com um período de antecedência."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Can't share tasks with anyone"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love it. it's my memory in times when things are busy"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"senang utk digunakan.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"A SIMPLE SUGGESTION 💡 Add tasks to phone notification, doesn't go away until marked complete. Add settings for those preferences and this feature. Please 🙏"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"really handy I like how tasks can show in Google calendar, but it would be nice if the different task lists could have different colors when shown in Google calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I don't like Google Calendar, but it is way better than this app regarding Tasks and their management. The only thing this app does that Google Calendar doesn't is to include Google Tasks in Android's contextual share menus. That's my only reason to keep this poor app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Improved very much since last time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It's a pretty worthless app to be honest."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good service"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Overall the app is nice but in case we skip some reminders, the app no longer reminds us again on the same day or next day."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it links up to my calender, sends me reminders, lets me organise my tasks, and allows me to add in due dates. it works as a perfect digital planner!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Dear Team, Please arrange to add the feature to show the completed subtasks as crossed horizontally. Currently it disappears completely."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helpful for students"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Does not sync with google calender, dumb AF."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"you need a search function in Google tasks in the app and on the web. Otherwise, it's pretty good. I think it needs to be more advanced for Google Workspace users. Also, I need to have reminders back, like with how it is with Microsoft."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"more features can be added"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It really helps me keep my stuff together"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Why doesn't it ring an alarm to remind the task?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Fan of Google apps and services, but not this one, please learn how to make ""Task /Todo Apps"" on Microsoft To.do, they have a witty UI And UX that makes this app like the prototype of a grade school student learning how to code. This app is lacking the feels to organize the task. 😔, please add more features, AND PLEASE MAKE THE WIDGET HAS AN OPTION TO MAKE IT TRANSPARENT. THANK YOU PLEASE READ REVIEWS AND CONSIDERATE IT."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Recently the notifications only display my email address instead of the task itself. Very annoying to have to expand each task to see the actual content."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple and effective. add tasks, to one of multiple lists, and check them off. move them between lists if you need to. surprisingly long lived for a Google project!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"need more professional"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"ui is comfortable"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I use it to make my grocery shopping lists. Comes in quite handy in a pinch!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple to use,daily reminders works great I've grown to love this app helps me with my everyday life as I tend to forget stuff all the time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Worst App ! Even after syncing my Google Assistant reminders it keeps throwing duplicate notifications for same event ..one notification from Google Assistant and one from Google Task App ! Also, if you don't open this App for few hours it stops sending notifications even when I have turned OFF my UNUSED APP settings OFF. It is sooooo....irritating!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I hope the Keep will retain it's own ability to set reminders, and not delegate that to the Tasks app in its entireity."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"😁😁"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It helps me to plan. I've learned that if you fail the plan, you plan to fail, and this is an excellent form for planning."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It was a very easy, comfortable experience!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"wish Tasks can have it's own broswer page and no only through the App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's simple and easy to use, but there's definitely room for more features as I feel it's missing some."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"very good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminders set by Google home don't remind me on my phone. When they do, they aren't timely."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"a ringtone/ring / bell is required at the point of time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"quite good at arranging my tasks especially if i want them set to date... could maybe include some sort of alarm or reminder a day before or three days the said task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"definitely helps me stay on track in the office and on the go!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Since early 2024, tasks don't pop up any more. this issue is intermittent. There's no point having a task app if there's no notification consistency"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"would be nice if you could re order the actual lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"💚💚💚💚💚💚 Thank You"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Decent for what it is, but I would love a redesign. It's simple and easy to use, but this is by far the worst ""default"" reminder app between the big three operating systems. Samsung and Apple both have much more detailed and capable apps with many more features. Wish Google would spend more time on this app and make it more like Todoist and TickTick or at least add things like collaborative lists and better organization"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I love this alot! Other than how easy is it to use on the phone, it's fast to access, no lag. Just for the computer, am thinking maybe parts of it shuld b like phone e.g.tapping the main task in the phone will bring you to the main task board, and I jst need to tap enter after taping on the subtask (in main task) to easily add more. I know there is shortcut, but its a little hard to remember. (Just what I think, maybe others find it easy).However, I use it on my phone more, maybe it's no prob?🤔"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app, i often use it for noting my work"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Simple to use with automatic link to Google calendar. Does not seem to link to other calendars"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple and easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"missing task sharing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I enjoy this app to handle my daily to-dos, but since it took over my Google reminders, it's been terrible. It frequently does not send the notification for the reminder. Reminder is in the system, but no notification. 😡"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The user interface is so simple & so cool. But a activity tracker should be there. It'll help us to track our habits."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like this app but I would like to see some improvements with downloading it on a non Google phone"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"No one does it better than google."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I use task for jobs to do and appointments"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"simple but effective"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good work"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It sucks. Before they moved the ""to do list"" to this app, I had no problems. Now, if I don't open the app (even with the unused thing turned off) it stops sending me notifications after a while. One of those ""tasks"" is to remind myself to take my contact lenses off. I've had 4 different times when I've had gone to sleep with them on because of this. Didn't have this problem before Google decided to move everything to this app. If it ain't broke, don't fix it, and you guys broke it 😒"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Fix the stupid notification glitch where it makes the task your email"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love tasks Google, in a heart beat finds all the shortcuts to the tasks at hand Quite amazing actuaiiy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The app is not working as it should. installed Tasks when Google deprecated Reminders. I needed it to save reminders I set through Google Assistant and then notify me at the time I specified. However, it won't send those notifications, even when I've followed all of Google's intructions for settings and permissions. I had to uninstall it to allow Calendar to send those notifications instead. It gets 2 stars instead of 1 because it can at least save the reminders/tasks I make with Assistant."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"well"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very easy to use"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Muy bueno."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app easy to use and save lots of time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It works and is easy to navigate, but doesn't have all the features I was hoping for."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's good. But one big weakness: you can't arrange, sort, or colour code tasks by priority. This weakness particularly manifests on Desktop when you have a lot of tasks each day."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Not bad"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"mantap , simple dan berguna"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good things"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Fast edit options"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Easy to use. Powerful. Would be five stars if easier or more obvious how to share taxes with others"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Great app, does the job. However with 6.1 update and two app updates, notifications show email address by default rather than task name and it requires the task to be expanded to view property. This is significantly less helpful and I hope it is fixed promptly. Otherwise it's a 4 to 5 star app. Update 4/18/2024: still no fix to notifications, now three weeks. Losing another star until fixed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"please can u fix recurring tasks to show up among the list for next month and not only show up for the current month it will make it easier to see what s ahead and plan for it thx"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Does exactly what it should, and integrates with google calendar, which is nice."

Ability to add subtasks directly through Google Calendar. 3. Ability to move a task from one list to another. 4. Incorporate multiple color options for tasks, similar to events. These additions would enhance task management and customization within Google Tasks"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"must have a snooze option. and the task should be displayed all over the screen."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"really like that I can acess my calendar and tasks all in one. and that I can access my tasks in one app - however I do feel that its not fully integrated with calendar, such as sub tasks having no dates and not being attached to the main task (since they have no dates attached)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I used to use Google reminders in combination with assistant and calendar. Then, there was a force transfer to tasks.

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app is like an assistant that has no memory and totally forgetful! Never once had it reminded me of any task that is in the app. WHAT'S THE POINT? Use this app at your own risk. It's like an alarm clock that never rings at the set time! USELESS! 0 ⭐"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Task reminders aren't displayed properly after the One UI 6.1 update. May Gmail address (instead of the task description) is displayed in the notification panel. Reminders also disappear after a few hours."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"/aA, sorry."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"fine app..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I don't see the point in it because my phone comes with Google calendar and they both feed into the same calendar. I also have a widget that displays a list of tasks and allows me to add a new task. Maybe some phones don't have this functionality but mine is a basic Motorola g50 and it does..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very usefull, I recommend to make an option to use different colour of flags instead of star, and implement a sign to indicate the percentage of completion of the task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good best better App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app 👏"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Really handy way to keep track of my to-do lists, which until now have been a fuster cluck within my notes app. love that you can have different lists and add notes to tasks. One thing that I think would really improve it- I wish instead of notes in the task, it had sub-tasks that could be independently ticked off within the task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"notifications are so easily put off"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I'm not very good with keeping up with tasks or time. I am using Tasks to help me organize and manage things better. I like that it works with my calendar and I can set recurring tasks with alarms. Learning how to organize my digital space to work in real life has been the biggest hurdle but after some time, I think I have it down to where I think Tasks can be the most useful for me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"not bad"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Sends notifications 40 minutes after they're supposed to alert me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"until now its ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app, compared to Apple's reminders, is such an improvement due to the simple fact that I'll actually be reminded on my phone's home screen of whatever reminder I set as compared to actually having to remember to go to the app. This feature alone has saved me from forgetting multiple important things many different times."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Widget doesn't seem to work properly anymore. I click the tick but the item isn't removed from the list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"good"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"freefree free fire game"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"My favourite task management tool. Wish there were more options for ordering tasks like date added, newest first, oldest first etc"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Could be so much better. This is a very clean app but lacks features. On the widget, there should be a option to see today's tasks only. Like I don't wanna see a task that is due in a month today. Also tasks should be sorted, like if a task that is due at 10 PM shouldn't be above a task that is due at 1PM."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Its a simple easy to use task pad"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great. should be have add time easy more"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Plz , provide more features"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"UI is not user friendly"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app doesn't work, you add tasks and all, no reminder, no notification, it's just like some piece of UI"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It useless w/o a G account. That's unacceptable if you're using a Google device because first party apps need to be service provider-agnostic, otherwise the manufacturer is being anticompetitive. That's the total opposite from Google that now incl a priv pol even w/the dialer. No wonder why it closed sourced it. Google should be sued...oh that's right, it already is. I already paid for the device Google, stop trying to monetize me bc, in this case, I'm your customer, not your product."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"not bad"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love that I can list tasks on my phone instead of writing them on paper."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love this handy app great job folks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"This app used to be great, but it literally quit sending notifications when things were due. A task app is pretty worthless if it doesn't send notifications at the time you've said it to remind you of something."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Great app, I like the simple workflow. Although I really miss a ""today"" page where I can find all of the tasks from all of my lists that have today as a date. That will be the ultimate functionality. I also feel the missing of a ""label function"", for prioritizing tasks. But great app, google"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"super"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great 😊"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I want to use it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and elegant"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Wouldn't know what to do without it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"the one task I entered keeps alerting me weeks and months after the task date and even after I marked the task as complete. annoying."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This barely alerts me of my tasks I'm always getting them sent at times that they're not supposed to send at, and days they're not supposed to send on. It seems very buggy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Absolutely helping me organize my life, the best thing is the connectivity and the digital environment that signs automatically with Google Calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Hate that we're not able to use Google assistant for reminders. Bring them back!!!!!!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Please add a search function. Google Calendar works better for Task searching than this app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I needed. Connectivity with other apps is helpful and being able to easily add subtasks helps to chip away at larger projects."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Since Google migrates the reminder to the task system. I don't receive notifications on my tasks anymore"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very simple and practical 👌"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"If I could just click the plus button and say ""Call Mr Smith tomorrow morning at 8:00 a.m"". and it works I would love it.

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I really liked it on Calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Don't like reminders showing up on calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Gute, einfache App zur schnellen Erstellung und Verwaltung simpler Aufgaben. Tolle Integration in weitere Google Dienste. Auch das Widget für den Homescreen bietet nun einen schnellen Weg direkt in die App."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I'm experiencing a lack of response from the app, and it's not providing reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"needs a share option, a translucent widget, remove the email from the notification, single click access to other task lists, and single click within notifications pull down for complete tasks/swipe to complete."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good application with excellent integration into the Google ecosystem."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Simple design and nice UI. Works fine apart from notifications. I dont get notification sound nor vibration. Notification is only shown on screen."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Update: so frustrating that it FAILS to notify far too often. While I am glad to finally be able to batch delete completed tasks...not allowing users to snooze is ridiculous. There is a work around through the phone since you can select to snooze individual notifications by 15, 30, 1hr or 2 hrs but it should be an option from the Task app itself."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The app doesn't allow you to repeat tasks with subtasks. I'd like to use this for work but I need the checklist to have subtasks and I need it to repeat everyday I work so I cant even use the app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Samsung, Google reminders no longer work"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Fantastic for managing both reccuring and non-reccuring tasks. I would just love it this app could also beabailbe for watches separate from the Google calendar app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Does this app have file sharing?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"নাইছ"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work. Had to uninstall the app to get notifications for tasks that I set through google assistant. I was not receiving notifications for tasks but they would show up in the app when I opened it. Uninstalling this app fixed the issue. I now get notifications for tasks again."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Very bad , not reminding on time , mostly late , and sometimes alerts twice for no reason. 👎"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"handy way to keep track of different jobs you want to complete"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Superb Application 👍👍👍👍👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I wish it had location-based reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"nice app lets me know what tasks I have done and what tasks I have remaining to do. I would suggest this app to people who are busy in doing productivity work or people who sometimes forget if they have done a task or not."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helps me alot"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Super simple!! super fun to *bleep* the tasks off when accomplished!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Unable to move repetitive Tasks to a different List and that makes it hard to stay organized"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The app does not notify me of tasks. I told all notifications to be heard and not one comes through."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's okay"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"not getting the reminders at all . need to know why I can't be notified about them audibly (audible). this doesn't remind me in text or any other method at all ever"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Tasks is a great app to have because you can view the things that you need to do. which makes your life easier to keep track of the things you need to do."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it designs our day perfectly....!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"God bless you Google. thanks sooooooooooo much."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"This needs a SNOOZE option like Reminders had."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it induced but still needs mango"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is extremely helpful and useful. I really do like the app it's not annoying like some other apps. FIVE STARS"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Its a life-saver for someone like me who keeps forgetting things easily. It works well most of the times. However there many issues. Sometimes, the reminder doesn't pops on time. It becomes late. It doesn't ring sometimes even if the reminder comes on time. And also a particular task opens up automatically when I open the app, without me doing it. The developers must add more features, like hourly repetition, option to change the position of list, option for attachment of audio, and image, etc."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good app... Would be perfect if it had the companion app for wear."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Very annoying and puzzling why ongoing recurring tasks don't appear in the upcoming tasks. They appear in calendar correctly, so the tasks app seems to fail in the one thing that would make it useful by itself. Giving up and uninstalling."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Fine do And it will be Done well..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The inability to set recurring tasks with subtasks is insane to me and a huge miss from an organization and workflow standpoint. Very disappointed to see something seemingly so simple not offered after a half of a decade of app availability."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works and syncs across all my android devices. Never looses my notes even though I factory reset and change often... Really excellent ...."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"With all the amazing eco system like Google calender, Gmail in its portfolio and this is the task app Google comes out with. Totally disappointed. Apple reminders and Microsoft todo is way better."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"did not remind me or send me notification of the reminder"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love Google. this makes doing things so much better. 10/10."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Useful but a bit clunky. Also needs the option for automatically moving all un-completed all-day tasks from yesterday, to today."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminders not coming through. Uninstalled and reinstalled which only fixed the problem for a week."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great todo app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Some features are missing like start date of a task and end date. That would be nice."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good job"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It really helps keep track of the list of things I have to do as I am very clumsy and often forget what I have to do next 🙃"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"please add colours"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Thank you for this app BUT it's really bad that we can't search across our tasks. And also it will be very better if we can select some tasks and move them to other lists with just one click."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Does the job! I love the little firework when I click a task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"current date should automatically be added"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Use it a lot. It would be nice to include a Checklist also. Would need to be updated and be able to clear or reset the list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I love how the app is built into the Google ecosystem. However, it is not as practical as other to-do list apps. It lacks basic functions such as priority and tags."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Does what you'd expect, but it's missing that ability to associate / relate tasks beyond simple nesting (groups, categories, ""depends on"")"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"a better reminder would be aeesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"This app was really helpful for months for me until the last few weeks when it wouldn't remind me of hardly anything unless I opened the app or more often now I'm getting late reminders like a few nights ago I got notifications or previously recorded instances of the same reminder so this app is definitely glitching and somebody needs to fix this cuz it doesnt do good for reminders at all now. Sometimes it works sometimes it won't. But recently it feels like it's gotten worse."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Similarity of the application for tasks. in fact does not contain any functionality to compete with other applications"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent tool, clear, instant synchronisation, love it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Too bad I have to uninstall this app because of limited functions. There's no sublist for individual tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful application"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Sadly, because all the tasks are added to your calendar, this can not be used for daily checklist like it is advertised for. Please add a feature to have a reoccurring checklist without it being on the calendar, I need a checklist to manage my ADHD so I remember to do basic tasks. Having them clutter my schedule makes finding my other important appointments harder."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Doesn't seem to notify if app is closed but otherwise good."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love this"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"please show me. I really have money"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I do not understand why this app lacks a search function. Seriously, Google can search your data but you can't? Wow."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"with the UI update, the task itself is no longer shown as the notification, instead the email of the account associated is"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works great! I like how it politely tells me what to remember."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's very helpful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"In itself a good app that is well built into the Google ecosystem, but unfortunately you can not have subtasks created and sharing is not possible. I also find that the design very much affects the functionality, since the lists above are all next to each other and you never have an overview. I think Todoist has solved this much better. There you can also set priorities, which I think is extremely important for productivity."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I may not have found it l, but it would be nice to have a button to uncheck everything at once. Otherwise, great app. 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"very useful, and easy."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"This is as bad as I thought it would be after reading the reviews. It is not intuitive, it does not allow you to repeat the lists on your calendar, it only allows for 1 set of sub activities, and I can't share it with others."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"a good to do list, works with the assistant so I can tell my phone to remind me to do things like I'm Jean Luc Picard."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The app is almost perfect. It does have a good design, and it is easy to use. But the problem that made it useless for my purposes is that it doesn't allow you to do the task again anytime you want. You need to set a regularity of X days, Y weeks, or Z months. Since I downloade it just to organize my work out, it doen't work well to me, because I don't do my ""A"" practice exactly every monday, it changes as the days go by. It seems to be a simple thing to be changed by the programmers"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It would be good if it integrated with Google mail and calendar better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This aap is incredible easy handle please provide I can smoothly handle without intrupption response quick"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent productivity tool! great on android devices"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I would like to reorder my list via the app & desktop version, but it will only let me via the desktop version but then it doesn't carry over to the app... smh the functionality in my book would be greatly improved with this small fix... is it really that difficult google development team?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great service Good Opportunity"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Would be great if plugged into Google Assistant. Date but no time alerts in the API so not great for desktop apps built using it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Rather limited in what it can do. For instance, if a task has subtasks, it cannot be repeated. Why not??"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love this app! Helps me stay organized and efficient throughout the day!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Repeat feature leaves much to be desired"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app for all the reasons mentioned before me. Some reviewers mention that having the tasks in their calendar is cluttering it up, but you can exclude all Tasks very easily in the calendar settings."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love this app, Integration with Gmail and the widget are perfect. Very helpful for tracking To Do and other lists from PC and Android"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I enjoy using Google tasks, however there's a very troublesome bug where the title of a task in my list disappears for no reason. The issue is that it essentially leaves me with no idea what the missing task was, which can create havoc."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good apps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"⭐WARNING DO NOT rely on this app to notify you at a particular time. It's completely hit/miss Notification from app is currently an hour overdue and I'm still waiting Luckily I remembered to do the task myself Then anytime between 2hrs-11hrs later, it'll remind you !! One time is was 6am the next day !! 🙄 Or, only after a restart. Forget uninstalling/reinstall, that does nothing If you want to be reminded of anything, this app is NOT for you 👎"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's basic and it works... Loads of basic free apps do a better job. Simple quality of life things would make an improvement. Better reminders. Ability to re-arrange subtasks Like. Concentrate on these a watch the ratings climb. Would expect better from Google. Google used to be about innovation. Money talks I guess. I mean, I posted this review with spacing and it's removed. Does anyone even try anymore? Bet all the Devs are on iPhones and don't use their own products haha"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"reminder not give alert properly 😔"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is great but may I suggest that it can have a time blocking function? Like you can set the specific time on how long you'll do the task rather than the time that you'll start doing the task itself. It will help to time block even more. Thanks for considering my suggestion!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The reminder never works. Either it will appear long hours after randomly or not appear at all"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"🆒😎"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No real time notifications"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't show notifications sometimes, so you miss deadlines. Used to be part of the google calendar app and used to be useful, but now it's not reliable anymore"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Clunky, not properly integrated with the Calendar, makes my user experience worse over the old Reminders built into Calendar. Just spent hours diagnosing a lack of notifications on my new phone because, despite kind of being integrated with Calendar, you won't get notifications unless you first go to the Tasks app. So thanks for that. Gets the bare minimum done (more than can be said for some apps). Slow to mark notifications complete."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Dont accept the googlemic,keyboardapp,the dialic in phone"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it reminds me about my reminders. and when it's time to rotate the heads in the basement. which is a lifesaver. If you don't rotate the heads every 12 hours, well... it can leave a nasty pile on the carpet. And that would be uncivilized."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's great. Hopefully Google doesn't kill it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Might as well use alarms. Needs location based reminders to be any more useful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"use the widget every day to organize my life and remember things"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"For example, I am created a repeated task everyday which will give me a task reminder in 11 PM. And the task pops ups on my notification on 11 PM. So far so good. But when the clock hits 12 AM (when new day starts), the task notification is wiped automatically from notification. Problem is I want the task reminder notification to stay on my notification pop up until I manually swipe it out or mark as completed. I think this only happens when you give task reminder everyday."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I can't share a task to my wife"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"wave on the postman bye"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"why Can't I resize the widgets to smaller elongated ones rather Long and big + the square shape?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The best is yet to come 🥳"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminder notifications don't pop up until hours and hours after the scheduled time, rendering the app completely useless to me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Tasks used to actually send me a push notification but no longer does. I recently asked it to remind me to pick up something from the store, but once it hit the time I asked it to remind me, I never got a notification. Lo and behold, the task still shows up in the app uncompleted. It only actually send me a push notification after I tapped on the task, set a new reminder time, and then reached that time. This definitely needs to be fixed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"What a mess! Why Google, now my assistant can't set a reminder, this is so stupid! One star because I can't give negative stars!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Compared to the task notifications that come with the core Android calendar, this falls short in a couple of key ways - no 2 click reschedule (a must for tasks), and I missed literally 2/3 of my tasks over the few days I had this installed since this doesn't reanimate overdue tasks. Back to the calendar for me!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Notifications for reminders come HOURS after the set time. Useless!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"reminders used to work flawlessly. now it clutters your calendar and also does not notify me. I only get reminder notifications when opening the app. pretty pointless now and will be uninstalling"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Getting this for tasks is bad. Why do I have to download an app? Assistant was better."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Nomanali"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Generally a good and intuitive basic tasks app. Would like an option to add reminders to tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"doesn't seem to have any advantages over the old reminders app, automatically removes notifications from yesterday even if the task was not completed. still takes far to long to see your full list of tasks(and I still have not found any way to open the app without using voice commands) it now groups all the notifications so that I have remember to expand the list to see them all(that could be my phone, but it did not work like that for the old reminders)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it's great and practical but would like to see reminders with sound notifications maybe, that would be perfect."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Just downloaded today. Need more time to evaluate"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Changed my mind, after 6mos.of use, and downgraded to 2☆. Tasks app is brutal when dealing with recurring tasks. I shouldn't have to refer to my Google Calendar/Schedule mode -- but I do!! -- in order to see (recurring) tasks noted in at future dates. This is just a bad build. Any UX testing? Did no one say, ""Huh?"". ""What's the logic?"" 2☆. That's it. 👎👎"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great with the rest of the Google apps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Simplicity and functionality are perfect, but there should be a way to show tasks from all categories in one view. I need a search, please! And can we get it on Wear soon?"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"thanks google"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's fast and convenient. I love that it's integrated into Google Calendar and has a web interface - can't think of going through my day without using Tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I enjoy the ability you put in to tick off tasks and subhead them."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Good if search function is included. Search function for those even if without date."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"amazing app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Using Tasks has absolutely helped me to stay organized. I use it daily and would be lost without it!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Not the best compared to other task management apps. The Inventory management is poor, compared to other great apps like Microsoft To-Do. The app is excels that it is part of Google's ecosystem but that's about it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Misses repeated tasks randomly. I have 4 tasks that should show up tomorrow and every other Monday - on my calendar but not on my tasks app. Frustrating that Google can't seem to manage tasks reliably."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"App is good but it will become much better if thy added time tracker or countdown timer"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Super and easy to use..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very useful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"works well"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"good, but no options to move lists in cell phone, only on computer from some reason, very inconvenient. Also no option to make sub categories and close them, so you can see only the task, and the sub tasks you see when you choose to open them, it could make life much easier."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"my USA account work account delete I want me personal account to be back on track"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Sometimes reminders don't go off and I have to manually open the app to get them to appear"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"More"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"wow this app is a quickest way to know what need to done next"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Reliable"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very excellent. However, please make task reminders work the same way with Google Notes. I mean, not just notifications but also alarms."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A very nice app, you need not remember any important work to be done any more, just mention it in the Task and keep taking reviews as per your convenience!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome 💯 benifits of this tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Awful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Only when I'm on the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helps me stay on top of my chores, keep track of goals, ECT. good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't remind you. When this garbage app was part of the Google app it worked perfectly. Ever since, even with all battery optimizations turned off, nothing is set wrong, it NEVER NOTIFIES YOU. Reinstalled 3 times before giving up. Use the Samsung reminder app. It's awful but at LEAST it REMINDS YOU."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"those who created gtasks are genius"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Can you please add a sound so that the reminder makes me aware everytime"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"ni aps sgt ber guna bgt"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Not reminding properly as needed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app does not do the core function of reminding you of tasks you set. I set one yesterday for 8pm and it reminded me at 3am when I was asleep. This has happened multiple times."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"the app would have made more sense if it had notification sound and/or popup. I mostly miss the tasks I set."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This has been a lifesaver for me because I can easily keep track of things I need to do throughout my day"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The subtasks are not linked together to the main task when sort by date (same in the web version), also when you complete a subtask, it disappears from the main task list instead just show as completed. It is a mess. To be honest, I can't believe it is a Google app. I will keep my Ticktick app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"STILL not showing reminders until you actually load the app!!! Useless"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I miss the ""reschedule"" button in the reminder pop-up! Nice app. Connects with calendar and Gmail easily. You should really improve the sort by date function, though. I like splitting my tasks under bigger tasks which gets lost as soon as one applies the sort by date. This makes things quite confusing. You could also consider connecting tasks directly to events in Google calendar (e. g. Grandma's birthday ← bake a cake). How about a ""All"" List?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"before tasks came into the equation, it was working beautifully, then when tasks took over, I don't get reminders that ive placed. Bring the old stuff back, I'm sure you've heard ""if it's not broken"". Seriously, do something about it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Now reminder comes on at 9:20 pm not 9:30 Annoying"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use. Has the functionality required. Love the integration with Gmail. Go for it!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it's good. but notifications should be better. like samsung's reminders app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love having a quick and easy way to track my to dos"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"conveniently useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Cannot send Notification. It says, the app is not in installed apps."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Tasks work well"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Sow to respond...!!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple, free, understands recurring tasks, and can deal with time as well as date. what nore could you want?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Amazing to keep myself organised"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it works"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The push notifications only work half the time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"keep it up don't settle"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The reminders dont come in often times"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I m happy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Set reminder using assistant for specific time, reminder appears 4 hours later..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Minimalistic, intuitive and responsive. I love it more cause it's integrated with all of Google apps and softwares."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"daily reminders are shown late, up to 3 hours after the time I set"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good 😊"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Please add search button"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The reminder in this app is not effective"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"check defects."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"getting to know thos it's ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"love It"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"So so.., Nothing Special..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Technoenripronner"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I'm giving it 3⭐s because I haven't had enough time to test the app yet, I just found out about the app 3 minutes ago... so I'll have to check it out first then I'll come back to grade it for real. so tell then have a good one. JAM. 3/14/2024"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's an useful app to do my daily tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I have repeatable tasks in a list. It would be great if there's a button that allows you to uncheck all completed tasks so i dont keep clicking multiple times just to uncheck them all. Also, when I uncheck tasks, the order i organized them in is gone even if it is sorted by my order."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Until Google designs the ability to create reminders without them being ""tasks"", I believe this just misses the mark. I don't know where else to place this review, but this is the best space because of it getting ""consolidated"" within the last year. I don't need reminders showing up on my Google Calendar. I appreciate having ""tasks"" show up, but it bothersome when my calendar is cluttered with reminders that I need to alert me when needed. When this gets fixed/created, this will be a 5-star!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple user interface, easy and quick to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app. love the style and usability"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"missing labels and in-task checklists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"suck"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nicely integrated with Gmail and calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Bloatware, no reason for this to be a separate app instead of a function in calendar or notes."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"UPDATE 3/22/24: Google has continued to make improvements, and this has become my primary task management app. Recurring task issues are fixed, and the calendar integration is now very strong. I especially like how pending overdue tasks get grouped under the current day, such that they don't clutter the rest of the calendar. Love being able to manage tasks and appointments in the same interface. ----- Not ready for primetime. The few features that are available work fine..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Google Tasks does what I want which is to help me set my reminders on any date and time in the upcoming year but it would be helpful if it was searchable"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great tool"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I was looking for something that was more integrative to the Calendar app. I would like to have the ability to include a location on a Task instead of making an Event. It is impossible on either app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"sometimes it forgets to remind you"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"very hit and miss with notifications, not reliable"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"メールやカレンダーをGoogle製で固めているAndroidユーザーにオススメ。Gmailからタスクを簡単に追加でき、追加したタスクからは当該メールへのリンクが張られる。期限を設定したタスクはGoogleカレンダー上の期限の日時に表示される。 タスク管理アプリとしてはシンプル。タスク管理アプリに求めることは一通りできる。 中の人へのフィードバッグとしては、タスクの詳細に画像を貼れるようにして欲しいです。贅沢を言うならばGoogle Keepの各メモぐらいの表現力が欲しいです。"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love how everything just fits together 😁"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good App. User friendly."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Hope to have a wear OS version."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It would be nice if you add alarm option for tasks. Some tasks require more than notification !"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very informative app. Thank you so much. Steven is going out of his way to help us. ☆☆☆☆☆"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"gr8 app! could be even better if it had priority and deadlines with reminders leading up to it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"best tasks app out there"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"First time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Fine until daylight savings and it set all task times backward an hour. My phone has the right time zone (MST) and I've restarted the phone twice since the time change. The email address given here in the play store replies and says this email is no longer monitored. Going to Google help, also no help."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"it doesnt remind on google pixel 8 using google assistant, this google reminder app doesnt remind you. I have given it all permissions it asked for, other apps work..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The save your time and information"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's strongly helpfull."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"works well for it's purpose, but I would like to. be able to save my tasks in a file if possible for safekeeping."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"despite having different task labels, every task I create all goes to one main label... ""My Tasks"" rather than Drs appointment, meetings, ECT!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great model"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I'm getting the hang of it. Might turn out to be better than paper notes falling out of my pockets."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like it so far just started to use it let's see how it goes"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"This app should really provide alternative notification options like full screen alarm like notifications. also on reoccurring tasks for some reason it doesn't show you the task until the day it's do and not before hand? odd choice..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Miss being able to add tasks with voice commands. Now Google AI (Gemini) won't allow. Gemini is terrible."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"মাশাআল্লাহ সুন্দর"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Reminders for tasks are broken. Setting up a repeating reminder is not independant from making a task repeating, as such, if I set up a one-time task and ask to be reminded of it daily, Google Tasks thinks this is a daily task and will ressurect it every day, even though I have marked it as complete. Maybe this is useful for short tasks like doing the washing, but it is not helpful for one-time long tasks that take multiple days to work on. I have already given feedback in the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I can set a task for myself and I have a notification bar to remind me of the tasks I've set for myself and at my chosen time, day or week. This helps me to stay on track and to get tasks done without forgetting about what tasks I've done and haven't done. I'm always forgetting about geting tasks done so I end up not doing what I say I'll do; this app has been a game changer for me and I couldn'tbe happier to be more organised."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I don't know if I'm doing it wrong, but for some reason tasks written here do not show up on your calendar. however tasks written on your calendar show up here. I'd like it to go both ways."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"not so advance like iPhone task manager, no search option,"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"edit of existing task may be improved"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I would like to have completed tasks immediately after my current tasks even in sub tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"i loved it, it's very useful for me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"pretty basic, nothing special"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Notifications don't work half of the time but the app is still functional to where it's not a nuisance to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"hard to setup but easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Barely functional. To choose a due date a year out you have to swipe through 12 months. This feels like the first task app ever developed. Like a joke by the developers. I wasn't expecting much, but seriously?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I can use it any time from multiple devices. Easy to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Did not like no option to share"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This needs per-list colors that appear on Google calendar🙏🏽 That would be an absolute game changer for organization and differentiation between lists that are for reminders and lists that are for stuff that's more urgent like a due date. Or if you want to be even more awesome, have the ability to change an individual item's color🔥"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No way to change start of week"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"no option to snooze"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Why don't Google Keep offer persistent reminders until we mark a task complete?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Om sai Ram🚩🚩🚩"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Has greatly assisted with my myriad of tasks and I'm very happy with Tasks. Would recommend to people on the go that really need to track their tasks with ease."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Gr8 app. I use the widget version and it was working fine, until about I think 2 weeks back, the tasks don't register if I add them through the widget. I have to manually add them into the app. Even then, it doesn't show up ont he widget. I have to remove the widget and add it again so that I can see the newly added tasks. Overall, it's a great app with simple design and serves its purpose well. Reply to this review after you've fixed the problem and I'll change the review to a 5star"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"You can clearly keep your task but it cannot reminds you to do the task, so whats the essence of it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Simple to use. Once I understood what it is used for, and what it's not, it has been a useful tool to add to the Google Calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"1st time to install this today. Will give 3 stars for now as initial test. Will proviee again another review probably after two to 3 weeks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminder never give notification.. in any way.. Just a waste"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"There should be a search function for both completed and incomplete tasks"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Bricked since Google's removed 'local account.' No, I am not having my day to day private life on Google's servers."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love the ease of use!!! I really like this app. it's simple, minimalistic and fun!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Alarms stopped working. No notifications until the moment I opened the Task app to check alarm settings. Very unreliable."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"My daily helper to manage my routine."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's the gud 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love the app. I would love to have more features such as a collaborative board with other people."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I love the app. It's simple and smooth. One thing I'll be glad to see is when I'm able to rearrange my tasks. I want to drag some tasks to the view of the screen as soon as I open the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"We need a option to share the tasks with friends or the Google one family as the events are getting shared."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like how simple tasks are. it's a very intuitive tool. although I'll enjoy some priorities markers or some way to make the tasks help me prioritize."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Very simple task app. Not very cross compatible between other Google services like assistant, as a shopping list is prioritized in Google Keep rather than here. I can only think of using this if you need a real simple bullet list for packing or keep lists separate but otherwise I would just use Keep."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Google has an amazing habit of ruining totally fine products. products that just work are mixed merged and thrown out without consideration. if I'm lucky the reminders don't come on time, if I'm out of luck the reminders don't even show at all. What's the point of an app which takes task list when it doesn't even remind you on time? I have since switched to another app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"get er done"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"terrible, unusable. keeps a draft forever and opens and tries to save a new copy of it every time a open the app. just another useless product from Google."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Bien"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"doesn't remind me as a notification, I lost a job because of this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Such a simple app but so useful!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I typed them in the order in which they should be done. I typed them in the order in which they come to mind. The problem with this app is I can't reorganize them. so the first thing I need to do is at the bottom of the list not helpful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome App!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Alerts???"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"cool app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I use it for everyday task, serves me well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it gives you a chance to give the creator his due and forsake lucifer no matter his name which are many and ridiculous though he keeps it up like he's a child of God and we are not hmmm jealousy you know it. I almost feel sorry for him then I remember All the people he has inslaved. Sad hope I can even help John the Baptist cause like most of us I know he did so out of fear. Our Creator is cringing that why he made me and let not Jesus no jealousy kill me. try it if you need proof."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work after gemini"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"an effective app for managing tasks. thanks to Google."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Address the mogwst important to me and the most important to me and the most important 7"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please add Search Task feature."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome application, an task list should be shared to another people."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"best google product we can trust"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Add whatsapp/phone call integration (if people use it for work...) and it will be perfect"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Utterly useless app. Doesn't do anything at all."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Not bad. It could use some of the features from Google Calendar, but it gets the job done as a scheduling reminder program. If your phone allows it, make sure that it doesn't pause when in power saving mode, in order to ensure that notifications are delivered in a timely fashion. It nicely keeps a running log of completed and reoccurring tasks. It's a little light on features but it does what it is supposed to do."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good free option. Would like a better way to rank priorities."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good system"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Had to install the app to try to get rid of a bs notification to stretch, never even set it up and of course there's no way to delete it either"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very Helpful. I use this app in my study😊"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is a necessity for those of us who are constantly on the go with little time to devote on drafting, sharing and maintaining their life y'in perpetual motion."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Basic tasks app, gives notification when a task is due. I use it for reminding me of things I need to do around the house, like changing the furnace air filter every 3 months."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I keep missing appointments. No real notification options. It reminds me of my appointments after they have happened and birthdays are the next day. I love having the ability to see my upcoming tasks and events in this list view and check them off but this app sucks because I can't figure out how to get actual reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Does exactly what it is supposed to do."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"creo que deberían agaegar más opciones con las tareas nose como poder agregar archivos etc"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"need more features and flexibility"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I get that it's supposed to be minimalist and simple which I totally get, and honestly like. But don't be afraid to add a couple more useful options or tools to add to note taking, productivity, or to stand out. Also, some things just don't work like moving one task from one folder to another... all but one is greyd out, doesn't move"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's great and all, but I'd like a ""today"" page that shows all the tasks I got today. Please add this feature"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Worthless without search function."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Love the app, BUT I feel an easy/major improvement could be that if you have a task group and a sub-task... when you mark a sub-task complete, add the task group name to the finished sub-task so it makes it easy to see what is completed. Would change to 5 stars if this is done."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"One of the best task managing app, we easily check which task need fo complete. But interface will be more good looking if you know we can add some color for specific task, like red for emergency/in need task, green for okay-okay task and yellow for less needed tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"intuitive design...all u need to know."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helps get stuff done"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"add the ability to share tasks with other's and collaborate"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Works well, would be great if users could share a list with others, for instance, a shopping list. That would be very useful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It is a very nice app that helps you structure you planning. I will recommend it to everyone"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Tasks are fine, but I hate the app within my Google nest hub. When I want to mark something complete or say, ""Ok, thanks for the reminder,"" my assistant starts reading all my tasks saved aloud to me..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Excellent."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"You cannot delete all tasks at once... it's useless."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Fun and easy to use!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice streamlined to do list app that does all I need it to do. I like the fact that it doesn't have a ton of unnecessary features."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I preferred when it was included in Google calendar- all in one place. I can't search for a specific task. Also, trouble finding old tasks that should come up yearly."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's amazing 🤩"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very easy"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Seem useful but still new to me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Very basic, but does the job. But wish it had more intelligent sorting of items in a list. Also no Wear OS app, which is a bit pathetic from Google."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app. Really helps wuth scheduling"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"really nice app, not overcomplicated, just what I exactly need"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app needs a lot of help. Bring back the normal Google please!"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"How do I delete my account?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I use this app on a daily basis and helps me a lot. I see a few missing features though. Listing them down here: 1. No app badge showing number of tasks overdue. 2. No option to hide the list. 3. Repeatable task is not user friendly, please provide options like done for this occurrence which will auto set the due date to next interval etc. 3. Provide more options to alert the user on due date/time like alarm sound, notifications etc. 4. Sort Filter by Due date etc..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Exelent"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I always searching an app like this"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"limited in customization and sublists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Not bad. A bit of a improvement over previous versions."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"There needs to be a feature for changing the first day of the week"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Cool"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"soooooooooooo excellent performance 🥰"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, help me keep a track of all my important tasks fluidly."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple and delivers what needed!"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"very good app. A suggestion ,plz add a timer along with date & time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works well, I especially like the integration with Tasksboard."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good reminder for me , easy to use , each task i can do clearly .. 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app helps me get annoying repetitive stuff done regularly."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't integrate with the new Google assistant changes. used to use it multiple times a day, but is basically worthless now. please change it back."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I didn't get any reminder at all 😡"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I'm very forgetful, so I use tasks a lot it's the best reminders app I have personally used."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Error message when I try to edit the occurrence section and task then disappears. Unless I copy and paste the task and create it as a new task, I lose each task completely that I am trying to edit. This happened after I got a new phone."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good and handy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Not being able to snooze a reminder was the reason I stopped using the app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"generally usefull.may be little improvement in the interface needed ."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's a good app. But I would like to request Google team please add one more feature of repeating of tasks after like (1,3,7,14 days) intervals thanks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very important"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"recommend"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It's extremely difficult to create a task because I can set a specific date, but the app keeps changing it to a different date. Last update causes the notifications not to work."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Clear"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"cual es su problema con la Gente negra?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love the integration across the platform. Any chance you could look at shared task ownership?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Hmmmm.... Well, could be useful¿"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Remove default functionality then force you to download a separate app to retain same functionality. The google way"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good work from googale"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I have adhd and it helps a lot"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"no pop out advertisement"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I think Google is not interested in thjs product. It is premature. When you edit a task there is no way to say OK/SAVE you just go out of the task and ot is saved. Stressful. I had a task 4 years ago and wanted to update it to this week there is no way to jump to today's date you need to go thru all months till this month. This product needs some attention."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"the notification holds till the midnight, after it disappears, no matter what I do in terms of battery options or given rights... useless from a reminder point of view which for me makes the full app useless."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"if really needs a ""Today"" tab, more color options and the ability to set various priority levels. I mostly use it because of the assistant / Gemini ecosystem, but adding tasks via voice is need more UX attention."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Aju Nicee"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and effective"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"AMAZING!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"does not provide search functionality. do not trust Google with side projects:; they will only do them half-baked. started as a great company but fell into the money-hungry cycle like everyone else. do youbremember their initial slogan? ""do no evil""? well they changed it. that should tell you all that you need to know"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"If this is the app that replaced the baked in voice reminder app, it is lacking. I like that it's simple and easy to use, but it is missing the ability to set more than one reminder alert. I need week before, day before, day of, hour before, etc. Also the ability to use voice is missing."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"amazing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love this!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"sometimes the reminder gets lost but this works well in general"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I wish tasks would have clear seperations. It's hard to read them since they are just text seperated with some space. Does everything really have to follow form? What's the point of me having a screen if I can't have the functionality of seeing anything I want?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Almost exactly what I wanted. Note to devs: It'd be great to have some bar chart for recurring tasks to see how do I handle them. I.e. % of closed per week/month/year."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Nags to rate"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"perfect app to track your to do activites"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"its good. need more features."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good but must introduce a specific app for other platforms like windows."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"As another said, mediocre. If we're forced to use one app with Google assistant then it'd be good if it worked well and had some more functionality... When I click ""Mark as completed"" on a reminder notification, the notification is gone, but it remains in my list in the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love . I use tasks all day. it works beautifully. I need to figure out how to use location to assist in reminders rather than times only."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Think about this one and it's personal that comes to my own tasks and with this app I can use that when I get there thanks for the free tasks Google"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"keeps record of every task So gr8 application much appreciated 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Would be useful if it didn't ""forget"" reminders intermittently..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to create, manage and complete tasks. Tasks show up in gcal too."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple UI to be used for your everyday laundry list. Pretty useful minimalistic app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good for daily routine work"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app 👍. Clean, simple and easy. Just wish you could coustimize the background"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Not useful, not well integrated with assistant or most other apps. For example, how helpful would it be to take a screenshot share to tasks? Nope."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"need more colors"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google Tasks connects to your Google Contacts App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Tasks are not going off at the right times and I'm missing important things"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"A alarm tune should be added to remembering the task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"can't sort by name"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Like this simple app and integration with Google calendar. Can't change the name of task list and their order"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"merge tasks and notes into single app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Hi. I really like this app. It's pretty simple and easy to use. What I would like to be able to do is to make a list active or inactive for instance I travel from location A to location B and I have different routines in each location so when I'm at location A I would like to make my routine A list active and routine B list inactive. That way I don't keep getting reminders from both lists when I only need reminders from one of them. This would help me keep both lists but get reminders from one."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's a good app but ""Ruppu"" is much better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"meh. it's greatest strength is integrating with other Google apps."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Will See"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Guys when you will make this app to Pixel watch, it is very important to planning!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Is there a way to set time zones? Every task reminder I set it doesn't remind me for the set time, but only the following day I'll get a notification. Kind of pointless"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Bug Alert: Google Calendar and Tasks Android App and website do not let default task list be deleted"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"onloy the best 5 stars see our Google gude line Googlepay"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Not allowing to set two times for the same task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"needs location based reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love this new app, it's very efficient. Previously I used Todoist which is also a great app, but this one is free, even more simple and also integrates well with the calendar which is great. I think it would be awesome if it would be possible to reschedule multiple tasks at once, i.e. have a multi-select option and to be able to reschedule multiple tasks for another day with the same times or with a new time for all selected. Otherwise great job with this app!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love this application 😍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Does what a tasks app should do for me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Lets you get things done as desired. Very useful app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I miss the old reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Broadly speaking, I hate Google. They no longer provide relevant results to queries and censorship of comments on Youtube is out of control. So reluctantly I write a glowing review of this app. Ease of use, instant syncing with desktop, dark mode and easy reordering of tasks and subtasks make for a great app. Great job, developers. I still hate Google. Oh yeah, needs sort tasks alphabetically."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"nice to have some templates with additional logic e.g. shopping list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"v good"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I unintentionally deleted every single list while maneuvering the phone in my pocket. No way to recover or undelete. Terrible!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"There is no option to open the app from the widget. I have to manually open the app to create new list or see the completed tasks list. I cannot do this from widget"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Hey guys, what about an ""All Tasks"" window and widget option? Seems pretty straightforward yet I can't seem to find it anywhere. Fix it please 🙏🏻"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Use it every day. Really useful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app to summon something to write on"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app has saved me from missing so many appointments and help keep track bills"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"There is an issues with Tasks. I won't get reminder at the required time. There is a bug."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"An amazingly fantastic app. It's a must for everyone to install it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"nag me for a review, get 1 star."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"just works"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"On s20fe 5g this sometimes doesnt work unless you open app. I faced issue several times"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"amazing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It can not switch between alternate calanders. So, one can not add a task based on a different calander rather than the default one, which is Gregorian calander."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I would like to be able to have a new task go into the right group automatically, separate groups for scheduled versus recurring versus ordinary."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Make Two Lists of Important Tasks and Minor Tasks. Star the Crucial Task."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"A great way to keep track of your tasks, works well, pretty simple. Overall a great app 👍."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Was the most helpful thing in keeping me disciplined with my daily tasks until the app won't even open thank you Google for preventing me from organizing myself just because I use a custom ROM to make my phone usable"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Really needs a wear OS app"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app. However, there are times when notifications don't work"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"always works great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"A must have app for people who write daily tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google tasks appear on G Calendar happy days"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Not bad but NEEDS a priority field Top, High, Medium, low. Currently only way to prioritise is by adding a star, Which is not a fine enough Granularity when working with a lot of tasks each day."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Why can't I just add reminders using voice commands this is stupid. I want to quickly add reminders cause my life is busy and I forget the simplist things. GIVE IT BACK LOL !!!!! This app sucks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Asadullah"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Can't rely on task notifications to appear. I get nothing and then when I open the app, the notification appears. I wouldn't trust it for anything important"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"If only the app uses regular alarms as a reminder."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Love this app!!! Please add a search button, it would save all of my time!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Tasks has been really helpful to me. What I would love to see is additional periods on the repeat option. I have a couple that repeat quarterly, and 1 that is every six months. Would love to see those options included."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"easy to use and works well with the Google assistant commands."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"If I set a task for Friday morning at 8am, Google calendar will notify me at on Friday morning at 8am. I like that. But if I use the Tasks app instead, the first notification I get is on Saturday. ""Hey stupid, did you forget to do that thing?"" Yes of course I did. Thanks for not helping. This may be an issue with the app's permissions rather than an intentional design quirk, but since following the in-app instructions didn't solve the problem, I was happy to give up on Tasks and use Calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"No pros and cons! Really simple and designed only for one thing - setting a to-do list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps with my adhd"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. 👏 I love how it syncs with other android devices."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it would be nice to be able to undo changes and bold text"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good services"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good, simple"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Done with Tasks !!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Just another rushed rubbish app by google, what would you expect lol at least this one isn't bloatware embedded into your device like the other google crApps."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like to use it, especially because the task in this app appear in google calendar too. But, i think it would be nice if the completed subtask not just disappear, but faded or maybe the text formatted to straight through until the main task has been completed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"How about you tell me when I could completed a certain task? Like the date maybe also try to not cross out the tasks I did as well?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"No sound notification possible"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Recently it hasn't been connecting to my other Google features so I have to go through multiple steps just to set one reminder I use this app because it is supposed to seamlessly connect to my other Google features like Google Assistant but recently it refuses. All the permissions are turned on but it will not connect. I have ADHD. I cannot remember half the things that I need to do so I use my reminders five or six times a day. I need this app to function as an adult and it's not working!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I added a widget on front screen so that I don't need to go into task app each and every time. However, the widget does not get updated when I add any new task in app. In addition, when I switch tasklist from widget it does not show underlying task for the list. Please look into this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great App! Very useful & simple enough it's easy to keep track of everything I need to get done using it. I would recommend this app to anyone who uses Google Calender because they link together and it makes your calender even more helpful for remembering what you need to get done in the future so you don't forget any important tasks. I do not need any other to-do list apps because this one does everything I need in a to-do list app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Won't let you change the label a task is under after you make a task. It's a little annoying"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ok"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Really awesome app This app me selected in IIT Delhi. Amezing help me in jee journey 👍👍👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"very good app only problem is that it is hard to share your to-do list with your business partners"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The application is so supportive in reminding the tasks but a suggestion to the Google tasks team to change the option for manually selecting the year in the app for while scheduling a reminder."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Appreciate the simplicity."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It is a nice basic app for keeping tabs on your to do list and such. Since it is from Google, it keeps if porting across devices and integrating with other Google apps or apps which support Google apps. Is there any way to archive completed task lists?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"5 star once Watch app has been created OR all tasks made on Google Tasks sync with Pixel Watch tile ""Next Task"" - missed out on an easy one there, fellas."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I suggest using different colour for each list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Free, but it will ask you over and over to review it until you finally do. It's fine/simple. Should have an option to bring old tasks forward. Google calendar integration pretty good/handy."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Unlike other Google apps, this app is not optimal for Persian writing and cannot be used correctly"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It does what it does pretty well, but having categories and regeneration would be useful. Also having multiple views of the task list would be very useful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Useful and quick functions. Widget could go better with smaller size contents. Wonder if the app interface went too simple."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Such an easy app to use and really streamlines my day and schedule. Having everything, short and sweet at my fingertips reducing my anxiety as well. I stopped worrying about what I need to do and forgetting something. I have moved forward to getting things accomplished and checking the boxes. Very satisfying."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Give me my Google reminders back, this app is awful and notifications are on and they never show up. And this is supposedly a ""permeant change"" I want the old version back, the easy Google Assistant reminders. 6/29 Still awful my 3rd review of this Garbage. Get rid of the permanent change for the love of God. Still awful as ever notifications don't shownup. 7/13 It's 8/18 in this app is still absolutely terrible nothing's ever on time. It's 2/21/2024 still my most hated app ever, terrible app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Needs more options for sorting task lists. I also don't like that there isn't an option to see your full task list without using the drop down menu (web browser version)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"really helps me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Garbage. They ruined the reminder system"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome app!! Very helpful & useful business tool 🤝📊"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's too good."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"FEATURE REQUEST: Add note attachment (audio+image) and better reminder configuration"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"could be a bit different where you can have more pages separate pages too write separate lists colors where you can change the color in your font on t different lists where you can change your fonts color and style ✨️ it'd. great thing but could be so much more have more thoughts just a bit busy right now.. thanks so much.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Plz also add color palette 🎨 option and some others like assign to me option etc"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Thank"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It's a glaring omission that certain tasks are permanently associated with the default list and can't be moved to a different list from the app, something that should be easy. Also missing is the ability to assign it share a task with another user."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works great. Just wish there were reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I am not getting a reminder"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"not getting audible notifications all of a sudden. I changed no settings"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"cons: 1. Can't add subtasks if the main task is getting repeated. 2. No way to see pending tasks of past days. 3. No formatting in description, like bullets or number listing. 4. No such feature like Due Date."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I hope they keep adding to this app and do not discontinue it like they have all the other effective productivity and scheduling features."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"simple yet powerful..! Please add an option to see only today task in widget or can filter by date and time in order to fully categorized the brain for list of task that need to be attentioned in the morning and starting your day."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"can't order tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Needs some added features like being able to order your different lists to your choosing without having to create them in the order you want. Also would be nice to be able to add subtasks when you hit new note on the widget without having to close the note and open the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"tasks is perfect for getting your list done for your family and business. 5 stars all the way ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Bugs too often and has to be reinstalled"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I Have Been Very Happy With Your Goggle Chat And I Have No Intentions Of Deliting It"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Needs a wear os app desperately"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"keeps me organized"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good 👍 please add more themes for background"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Wet"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's simple n excellent app . very much practical app which has really been enhanced by Google Calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Can't share a list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps me organize my day"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app has literally one job, but it didn't notify my phone until I opened the app itself... This shouldn't be happening Google as app notifications are fully allowed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app. Although I wish there was a feature to repeat task on an hourly interval as well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google Keep and Task are unvincieble and most useful pair of apps for everyone"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"please add shamsi calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's good but could do with some UX improvement. Like being able to drag and drop a task in to another list etc."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"often fails to send notifications"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"very easy to use, works like it's supposed to, wish I could repeats for lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"not as seamless with Google calendar as I would like"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app. The best feature is that it works well with the Google eco-system. The downside is that it is not as powerful in it's features as some of the more advanced apps."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"After the latest update the task list no longer updates after checking off a task. Only after removing and adding it back to the screen does the list update."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"id just like this app to hover over my screen"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"We going to find out today"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's a good app but I find it frustrating that I can't add subtasks to a reoccurring task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Simple task manager that's good for the basics"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very very best app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"App is great but needs much more attention when it comes to upgrading it's features"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Way too skeletal for anything beyond the most basic needs."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Include"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app but there's still room for improvement. I really wish the notification alerts are like that of the Google Clock where I can pick individual alerts or ringtones for the different tasks that I have created."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Okay. It could be a better app if it was integrated with calenders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's the best .i adice you ☺️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I love the simplistic and easy use. Please add a ""reset list"" feature. Some tasks are one-off and can be organized on the regular task list or a list for a specific project. Others are daily, and this app is much easier than clogging up a whole day on the calendar. Resetting the list makes this easy and I would appreciate it to be available from the widget as well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"😊"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"App should have more reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"What's missing: (1) a page where you can visualize all daily tasks. If I have to open another app - calendar - what's the point? It should show also events. (2) An option to manually select colour by task and by list. (3) a system to prioritise tasks. Starring works, but does that pop up in the calendar?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"integrates very well into my personal workflow, just wish the editing window was more clear, when I choose a new date I have to hit save and then the screen doesn't look any different, so I hit ""mark completed"" by mistake. Samsung reminder app is better in this regard. but I love this app otherwise and how it shows on Google calendar too."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"can only have one level of subtasks, cant have subtasks on a repeating task, no way i could find to set reminders/notification style, etc. just find a different tasks app that works with your calendar, cause this one won't"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Gulf food"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It's stupid that this app doesn't feature sorting alphabetically"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good morning &good experiences, regrds,rds"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The only thing stopping me from using tasks is the fact that i can't pin some tasks to the notification bar ,sometime you forget a task and sometime I don't know the exact time when im gonna do the task so please give us the ability to be reminded all the time ."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"should have had an option to add files, images etc"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I use it for noting down my everyday tasks. This has a feature of subtasks that help me complete a task 100%."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Tasks doesn't know this, but I own more than one business and tasks allows me to be organized and functional, and buy groceries for the house while on-the-go! They also don't know that I am a CRITIC and they passed!!! follow ASK HEATHER on social media to find out WHAT DOESN'T WORK AND WHAT NOT TO BUY!!! I'm Ask Heather, and I approve this message! send it!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Every other to-do list apps has a ""Due Date"" feature, yet Google Tasks does not."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app for tracking taks, and nice widget"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this app is great for accomplishing tasks! It's simple and easy to use, I can actually make a list and follow up on it. I'm not sure why other apps failed me in the past where I would use it and then I would forget about it and then I would come back in a couple months and look at all the things that I wanted to do and I didn't do cuz I forgot to use the app. I think these tasks were part of Google system for a while but they had no home and now they have a home and that's great."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I'm still learning on everything"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Does not trigger alarm! I need my reminder to wake me up out of my sleep if necessary. This app essentially sends a text message which may not be heard. Imagine having to send out bills at a particular time and memory being clouded by other important daily tasks. This does not help at all."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Cannot use custom notification sounds for task reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"allow better dictate capes"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very nice and useful app i love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Please add ability to edit time and date more easily"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Love the app. App missing huge point though. you can share a calendar with another person but not tasks. I don't understand why. This'll make the app have 5 stars."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple yet powerful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It lacks lot of features compared to Microsoft tasks.......needs lot of development."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great for tracking my multiple to-do lists. I really hope Google continues to add more features."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Amazing tool. What is misses is the option to filter things for today or any particular day. If that's the available, even premium version too beneficial. Because it's super fast and simple."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Need to have the option to copy/duplicate tasks. Moreover, the recurring tasks don't show up in the list of tasks until the due date. That also needs to be fixed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Reminders are 2 minutes slow to remind you, why?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I can't give a very possitive rating on this app. Reason being, I have never felt this app has been completed. Unless I'm missing it, I always felt this one should give a reminder, a list for complered items. Just always have felt it could use "" Extras "". However, each individual, could design their own as needed. This is why I rated with a 3 star, for right down the middle."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"so great i love"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Improve the widgets! More resizable. More features. Also - add a setting for ""scheduled recurring tasks"" to only show the next occurrence in the google calendar app. (otherwise there is just repeated tasks cluttering the calendar)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I'm a very forgetful person. This app is simply amazing! I have every task with notifications and never miss a thing now."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Google Tasks is simple in use, but lists gets stacked over time, decreases in efficiency. Make an option to archive them"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it is the best"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great for reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"they are bothering to Alexander brookside qkexq battles get the spwtulas"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"bar graph should be available how many tasks you have done .there should be a quadrant thats"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good, nice to mange one's self a f time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Google really screwed the pooch with this app. Reminders, assistant, sir and a million other apps already do what this one is for, only better."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I tried everything but it doesn't notified on time and some tasks even missed without notifications"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminder notifications stopped working. That's just simply, completey unacceptable. 2024-feb-6 they have stopped again! What's going on? Edit: 2024-feb-13 uninstalling returns Task notifications created via Google Calendar. Madness."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good minimalistic app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like it, remind me all what I mark. So now, I have almost no troubles )))"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Bring back snooze option! Clearly people who work on this app don't use it!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Tasks works well especially with other apps. Setting up however is not that straight forward. Fine though."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I'm greatly surprised this has a 4.4 star rating. The app is ""ok"" but it wld b good 2 ask r u sure u want to complete, etc cuz it's toooo easy to hit circle accidentally then u realize too late it's gone from ur active list ALSO wld b soooooo helpful to add search feature in tasks. Word search that is within tasks. Tx!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app. Helpful to remember the appointments and thing's to do."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I'm loving it great great way to keep track is what I need to do"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nyc aap"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"there are some features i might think be useful, but for now this does the trick"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to organize. Sync across all devices."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"best task app in terms of simplicity and connection to calendar. one thing missing for me, is a simple way of documenting the duration of a task, actual completion time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Perfect to set reminders and organise your day"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Search button is must in Google Tasks so that one can search for tasks and other items"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"yeah really good task management app. basic app for basic thing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Wonderful, but has a writing arrangments lack, like if you write in arabic it will be hard to modify."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"pay my oreedeoo very good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"13/02/2024."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I still prefer the old version where the completed task stays where they are and not disappeared and moved."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"not a problem using, but I liked things before, they weren't broken."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It's pretty meh for a Google product tbh. Would be great if it had the ability to set time/durations for tasks and if the interface with GCal wa smoother. Edit: it's getting worse somehow? Now I noticed when I create a task, sometimes I have to exit/restart the app to create subtasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app for checklists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"You can't share task lists, unless you have the workspace version of this app. This really should be a basic function."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Write a task, check it off, repeat. No learning curve, no distractions. Just pure functionality."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"need to be able to copy list to another account"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Much better than apple reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app. Minus a star for no task sharing to another account or with other users or apps except Calendar. Will be perfect with sharing and exporting to pdf and word."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Please include a habit score and re ordering of tasks is not efficient. You have to re-order them daily."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"not showing notifications"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"won't get rid of ghost tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It is now sending me reminders from. 2 years ago!! I can't turn it off. I can't go to a calendar to delete them. It's so very annoying!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very little used by me but used once in anger and it worked for me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love the simplicity of the app, but I'd love to have a list archive, I have a bunch of lists that I don't care about seeing on my home page but I don't want to delete"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Bangin App! #Lesgo 💪🏾"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I love the way it interacts with my Gmail"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Great reliable app. But I feel like there should be a setting where the tasks I have completed are deleted immediately I mark them as done after the day and they don't stay archived in my list. I understand the reason why they are archived, but in my opinion, they should be stored somewhere else outside of the list. If these settings already exist, please I need help understanding it. Keep improving the App. Thank You."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app helped a lot"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Update asap"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"quick action to complete"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ossum.. everything perfect.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's a lifesaver. I only wish it had the feature to share either a task list or single task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"one of my most useful apps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good app. But make it available for Samsung watches."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Warrants isolation; all while compounding a foundation I am proud to create from my own conscience. 🥵"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Now we have Google keep with tasks support and independent app called tasks and independent app called calender . Google lack solid vision and this make customers confused. Many google products disappear. Some did basically the same thing or compete on the same goal. Duo, meet, messages google+..... Facebook and Apple both have better vision and planning for their products and generally more solid products."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"the app is not well connected with the chrome extension"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very simple yet very detailed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple and unclutterred"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Confused between Keep and this one apart from collaboration option. And there's no sync option across these two either if there's indeed a reason to have these two separately"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminders don't appear so they are missed. Horrible app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"exactly what I been looking for"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helps a lot in reminders, follow ups, keeping on track."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Upped rating to four stars as had to use of late and appreciate it's advantages a lot more now."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app for everyday tasks. Please add option for alarm on pending tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"gòood"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Where's alarm? Whats the point of having timed reminder if its not even reminding me on the mentioned time?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Greetings, it's a good application however, it should allow three features for naturally real ease of use. Number 1 Feature is to allow& enable voice recording/ photograph or video recording to be embedded as a TASK. Number 2 Feature is to enable Date/Time Stamp with each task Number 3 Feature is to enable synchronization with Google Calendar Thank you again for providing us with this good utility application, however further incorporating the above mentioned features will definitely enhance it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"For whatever reason the week calculation is wrong, (set for 51 weeks, the due date is less than 51 weeks) and can't set more than 99 days."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT THIS!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Poorly designed hatful app Can't remove tasks can't undo can't do anything that would make this useful. I'm surprised a child didn't make this app cause it's really really bad."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good app, helps me get things done. My one complaint is I wish there was a way to select multiple tasks at once. Other than that, its a great tool."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Awesome app. Just add some security geatures like fingerprint and passwords"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"just gets worse and worse as time goes along."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I think it's convenient"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's a very robust and good app! Super recommended"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Got hacked"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"No notification commining"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like the integration with Google assistant. But I would love for this app to work more like the ""Alarm Clock"", where scheduled to-dos clearly pop out unlike other notifications."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I Love it!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"amazing!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"New ""tasks"" no notifications for reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"alarm should be there for each reminder."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I miss Google reminders, it forced me to switch over to this app now none of my reminders ever go off, I have it linked to my calendar and my calendar reminders no longer go off either. Garbage"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"not receiving notifications for my tasks. made two tasks today that didn't notify me when they were supposed to (8am and 2pm). just made a test notification for a minute in the future and they all popped up. using pixel 7 pro."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this app it helps me control my schedule"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Hello 👋 there I didn't realize all was completed I haven't received notification of full Key control etc help"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"PORTFREE"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Need a feature to view all tasks from all lists in one go"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Works well with other apps. However there's very little customizable options, at the least this app needs bullet options to strike through as you complete tasks. Decent app but definitely needs improvement"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Impressive💞 worth it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"a must have to get things done"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's a decent little app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google Tasks are ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!!. Something pops into my mind that needs to be done. I run over to tasks and create a reminder or tasks and then I do not have to ever worry about things that I wanted or needed to get done. They are some tasks I have forgotten completely about until I look at the tasks list. The tasks list appears on my calendar when I have attached a date information with it. I can create custom list. I highly recommend it and use it every day."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Why is this widget so shite compared to the one on my iPhone"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it's a nice and simple app, that's great! no distractions, just focus on the thing. however, it would be great if subtasks could also have subtasks and if a priority can be given. also a sort on priority function could be added with it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Inefficient, lack of desktop app support, no natural language support."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"You need desktop app and shared tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Simple, yes, but missing all the simple features; how does the app have NO search features, or a feature to rearrange the list order? There are no recurring tasks either. It's so simple that it sucks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Worst"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,":) It makes me Happy!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it is easy to use and help remember things"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Hey, it's good. you can try. Millions of people using it including me😃"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"One very big drawback (for me) is the task list can not be shared"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"A good app, but it needs a search function. I would even buy this app if I could search my tasks instead of sifting through all of them every time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It should have a list tab where all of the items are there. Overall, it's a good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's really a good idea to copy all the lies from my scammer."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love it!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Very shaky. You mistakenly press a task to edit and it marks it as done. Delete sometimes deletes the wrong task. Takes time to update."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"perfect"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Don't need it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Pretty good....pretty good...buuut.... Features seriously needed: *ability to move tasks to different lists as organization calls for *share a task via text message that the recipient can open and add to their own Tasks lists *possibly the option for ""shared lists""- the ability to collaborate on a list basically... Add those and I'll change it to 5 stars 🌟 🌟🌟🌟🌟"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Super application, thanks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"excellent app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"ok but the hit area for task completion is very fiddly. quite often when I try to complete tasks I end up bringing up the task details. interface needs to accommodate a bigger area for selecting task completion."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"so simple. easy to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent application to track quick actions"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"exceptional"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Can't search for tasks, which makes for a one-star app. Task notifications should be persistent and should stay in notification panel until either marked complete, snoozed, or a third option to dismiss. It's too easy to accidentally clear all notifications."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I have only just started using this feature on Google. I find it useful to add my tasks to my calendar. The app is fine, but I have two critiques. My first is that you cannot find tasks that you've already completed (it would be useful to be able to see them to show progress if you want or to uncheck a task if you accidentally check it off). My second is that there is no separation between different days on the list (having some separation would be helpful in planning your day)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Too much padding, and not even a lame attempt to allow preferences. Inefficient, especially on a phone. I don't want lots of white (or dark) space between list items, I want an efficient way to manage my To Do lists (sharing with my family). This app is simple which might be fine, but the visual design is a fail."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good and simple app with all required features. I'm using it but little bit afraid of Google decide to terminat this project someday"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it Does the job I do wish? It had the ability to add pictures"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"greatest app ever. I tried several tasking management apps but this one is the best , its best feature is that you can connect and sync with your Google calendar 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"just bring back old tasks that you can see in calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Must need for Productivity tools"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Tasks has been very helpful in planning preparing and expressing many things I had to do"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. That is the main advantage to me. But sometimes it reminds after 20-30 minutes later of exact time I set."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this app it helps remember things I need to do and has problems or ads like the rest !!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I set a reminder at 1PM, it actually notified my after 45 minutes, what is this?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Used to work great. Not sure what's happened with the app. It's been many months since it's worked properly. Figured if it was a bug, it would have been fixed by now. If you need reminders for your tasks, do NOT use this app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I have not head any recent problems but I have had a problem with some people saying that some of the software that I developed is intellectual properties and considered their. I can basically make anybody say what I want them to say"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"As countless other reviews have mentioned, there should really be a search feature, and I can't imagine it would be a gargantuanly difficult task for the brilliant SDEs at Google to accomplish. Perhaps for its change management bureaucracy. We await this common sense change patiently, thanks. EDIT: Another star has been removed, as the ""Subtask"" feature is also not functioning in a helpful manner. When you add a Subtask, it shows up like a normal task - it should show up like notes/details."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Yeeehaaa!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It would be great if this app were available on wearOS"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Too simplistic"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"before I could set tasks without an app. that's annoying but otherwise it's fine"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"My old iPhone was better at reminders because it would keep dinging at me till I shut it off. Maybe there is a way to do it with androids that I'm not aware of?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Not as good as Google Keep which unfortunately no longer works with Google Calender. It is also in desperate need of Search functionality"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Add a possibility to change a task color for different lists. Once it's synchronized with a 📆 it's a complete mess on the screen with one color."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Getting there! happy to see this existing and it's already replaced todoist for me... but isn't quite as manageable. hard to navigate between lists on mobile right now... but I'm sure it'll reach 5 stars soon!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Ñot sure but I used like all the differwnt thing the thing did"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"mast"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"best task tool ever! integrates with Gmail and calendar too!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"clean app. does what it says."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Love this app and concept, but I'm not really getting notifications for my scheduled tasks anymore. Getting notifications is really helpful as a reminder for a task but it's been really inconsistent."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"the only amazing app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it definitely keeps you notified by either email or on a smartwatch! You know if you set a reminder task it lists it all out for you and you can prioritize things! Also, it did seem to make it very difficult to use my voice commands the way that I was used to using it. and with the option of having that task repeat for a week ..or a month is very handy when you're dealing with a procrastinator"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Changing the date to tomorrow or later today is cumbersome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good organization"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app sucks! You can’t put any details in the tasks. Consider this Uninstalled."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"hi, I think you need to add a photo feature"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"> @m satisfied."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminders used to be part of Assistant: I set a reminder on my WearOS watch, it would notify on my watch. When Reminders combined with Tasks, things broke. If I want a voice reminder to show on my watch, I need to install Calendar on my watch (there is no Task app). If I don't want Calendar notifications on my Watch, only Task notifications, I'm out of luck, because turning off Calendar notifications also turns them off for Tasks (there are separate settings for each, but it doesn't work)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"lag"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Honestly clashes with Google keeps too much to fit in the same ecosystem. Merge the 2 apps"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Hackers"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It'd be nice if you could attach an image to tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love it!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"should be able to rearrange subtask based on importance or just have a checklist option like Google keep."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"would be nice to sort by alphabetical order"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"this app is very well ❤️‍🩹 and I can do work easily and systematically"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"There's absolutely no need for this app, it just adds a task to my Google Calendar which I could have done in the first place if I wanted it..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Limited functionality compared to competitors. No location trigger, no attachment capability, not even default notification time, no CalDAV access"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"convenient and great ux"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app replaced reminders. I get my daily reminders days later, after opening the app. Sometimes not even then. Terrible."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Tasks do not sync to my Samsung watch. Calendar reminders used to, but now only calendar events sync to my watch. Fix this, and I can amend my review."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"notifications don't pop up on time. previous version was much better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Let me repeat reminders after hours / mins"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Glad that I have this app to keep my day-to-day schedule available at a glance."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like it. It's easy and simple to use. Helps to keep my life well organized."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's good, the only reason I won't be using is that it doesn't play a rewarding sound when you complete task. That's the only reason preventing from switching from Microsoft to do"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple, easy to habitually use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google privacy business cloud engineering API"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It doesn't work, mainly for the reason that it DOESN'T GIVE YOU ANY NOTIFICATION OF THE TASK, despite the fact that all the notifications were enabled for the app etc....what use is an app to remind you to do something if it DOESN'T REMIND YOU TO DO IT???"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"ধন্যবাদ বস"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. I love the different that I can create a seperate tab for each individual task. Excellent App."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Material You!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I have DND enabled AAAnd the Task app seems to override them even without the allowance to do so.. why the f?! yes I want to see Notifications, but I dont want Notification Sounds at all, why can't I disable it?? at least give a option to make a Vibrate Notification at least?? or do I miss something somewhere?? Or a Option to allow a single Task to trigger a Notification sound? since it is connected to the Calendar app?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love having this feature ✔️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Waste , fails ti remind event"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So Far So Good #sachinsingasane"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ok Thanks I."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I am using this app since long, it is one app for my to do, reminders, note, everything. It is very easy to use. One thing I always miss is that it has only check ✅ box tick option, there should be option of taking note in bullet or numbering form as well. Even, there should be option to take note without check ✅ box or ticking or numbering or bullet, etc like available in other applications. Rest is simple and user-friendly."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"nerds it's own tab."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Devs need to add the ability to add subtasks when creating a task, as well as attachments files. The ability to schedule a task is a great feature that MS To-do doesn't have and is the main reason why I have moved over to Google Tasks. But for the former reasons, I find it hard to abandon MS To-do completely. I would if these features were added and I'm sure many would as well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I have reset this app several times and restored my tasked and or redone them but NO MATTER what I do..... I never get notified.... if a task was set to 12pm and Iopen the app at 1pm, then I get a notification about the 12pm task, which is an hr late and only showed up cuz I opened the app. Battery optimization is disabled and full permissions are enabled."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very easy to use. Thank you Google 🤝"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Still learning how to ask Google's Assistant to manage more & more of my day to day Life. This is funny most of the time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Not very useful.. Even future task that need to done after 3 years show up in case no other tasks are there before that. There is no option to see tasks for tpday or for 1week etc"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It it a great tool that can be used daily it also provides a great way to account for redress and growth it is also an effective way to provide measurement into the amount of energy that is invested to ensure certain tasks are completed at a specific time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"One of the best free to use task app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Hello Devs, Thanks for the great app. Would it be possible to get search option for completed and uncompleted tasks??? Many thanks!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's cool. Gotta lot more to learn & get familiar with. But its mucho useful 📝🙋🏼‍♀️✍🏽"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Google assistant tells me THIS app will handle my reminders. It does not. Just a popup from assistant at my reminder timeslot saying ""Tasks will soon be taking over reminders, make sure to turn it on in the app"" and does not tell me what reminder I set. All toggle options are ON in tasks. I need effective reminders, i want to use assistant for that as I did before. This system is useless now. Notifications from this app DO NOT WORK, the whole reminder system is fundamentally broken now"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"there is alarm or notification sound for the task reminder"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"need improvement which can easily viewed in Google calender"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Fabulous App, please provide options to shift list front and back."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this app!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very helpful reminder system, highly recommend."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Had been using it for months and gave it high rating. It was great. But for the past few weeks it's been just terrible, not bad or worse but terrible... It doesn't even bother to give notifications again... And when it does it's hours after the set time. For example I set a reminder for 2pm but instead get notification 5am the next day... Most of the time it never comes up... But, I just finished updating the app, will return to change review if there's improvement..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"needs a widget..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"гарний додаток."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't understand what This Thursday means. Example: I ask to set up a reminder for this Thursday (coming Thursday, today is Monday). It sets reminder for Tomorrow and not coming Thursday."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Google please add the feature of duration to tasks. If it's a 3 hour task it needs to take up 3 hours in my Google calendar. I can't give this more than 2 stars without this feature."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"2024. Google knows shortcomings of their apps & services yet it chooses to ignore them & bring halfbaked & substandard product to users. Using Google tasks since its beta days but till now no improvements whatsoever. To sum up this, Google has made zero website or web app for this for desktop & tablet users. You have to open Gmail to use this even if you want deep work focus (read: Cal Newport). No repetitive sound reminder if u are lost in work or notifications. Please integrate with Notes. 🤮"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"A basic personal task management app. it fits neatly in the Google productivity suite. Limited by not being able to share or send tasks; there are many alternatives that are greater for families, work groups, clubs, that also link with Google and other systems."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"color coding would be a plus"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very helpful app. Would be nice to have the option of [sort by my oder] in the starred tab, and have a list of all task(from different list) to see at glance."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Simple app. Works well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Totally useless, notifications don't work.if I reboot the phone it works for once but then stops notifying for timed tasks. I see that many have same issues..Quality of Google services and apps has been degraded over the years, although I have been a loyal android user since from the beginning, I began to think of migrating to IOS ecosystem. It is not acceptable that pixel 7 experience worse than my experience with nexus 4 which was 10 years ago."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"App is good, would like easier with interface"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The reminders are not accurate, they come in insane delays like 15 minutes, and they keep showing up twice after you swipe them off, and sometimes they even trigger in the wrong days!"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"please add something like daily journal that will make this app most productive so far"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Awful! I do not get notified of reminders I set. Can Google just leave well enough alone? Nope! Should have just kept reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helped me improve a lot"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"1. Reminder can set on single task but not on task list. This will helpful if I have created Sunday task list. 2. location based reminder of list of tasks when I will travel a particular place. 3. Tasks app is not available in android smart watch."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this is top!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"probably way too soon for me to review this app but it seems to be a nice addition to my 'Notes' and Calandar- bullet point list items I can cross off- just gotta figure out how to make all these apps work with each other and then how to setup or share my calendar and some tasks, maybe even a few notes but not all of of either tasks or notes which would inundate my wife with my madness. be nice if they let me allow a personal AI to do some of the more basic tasks in these apps..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Valuable task application."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's very good reminder application for every single day your task 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"needs more options, especially the mobile version."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very resourceful to me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I love the app, but it only drops reminders as notifications and doesn't have the option to make the reminder a loud one. I prefer that options to choose if the reminders should ring out loud should be included. I would definitely stop using Google assistant for setting reminders since since it doesn't support my Samsung Reminder app, which reminds me like an alarm."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I'm not getting any reminder notifications"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Keeping me in touch with what is important"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No notification sound during screen off. I can't use the phone or open it the whole day. So, I searched another app it reminds me with noti sound during screen off. I found it. It's Xiaomi's Notes app. I'm using it now."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Delicious"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"easy to use and convenient"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and no frills, as it should be, and no payments or advertising - two criteria it's very difficult to find going through all the other apps."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Handy app to view all tasks/reminders. I wish it would stop changing my personal notification sound back to default for whatever reason, maybe phone update or moving reminders again as it really throws life off the rails."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very good 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"One star for forcing me to download another app for something that used to be a part of the assistant app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I used to love Google tasks... I use it organize almost every aspect of my life. However I'm going to start searching for a new app because Google Assistant keeps trying to control Google tasks when I don't even have Google Assistant installed. It's beyond frustrating to keep getting duplicate notifications I didn't ask for - and yes, I do have Google Assistant disabled on both my Google profile settings."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Garbage. Ever since it took over reminders I'm never reminded. Useless AF"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"This would be a better app if it came with a widget that gave you the option to see tasks on your home screen"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Outstanding information. First thing I read in the morning!😃"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"How to improve"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great one on one"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"LOVE WIDGET"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Easy to add tasks and simple to use. Biggest gripes are: - the lack of attachment support - the widget doesn't group by days or provide a Today view - it doesn't tie up with the richer content of Keep to show those reminders in one place - there is no option to view all the tasks from multiple lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"tasks management ke liye top app hai"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The app was fine, but the notifications no longer show up at the correct time or at all."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Total shame not being organized. Thanks for Google's guidance. Sometimes we just need extra help."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Seamless across multiple devices."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Groovy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like Google tasks, a lot. Easy, straight forward, linked to my Google Calendar, good reminders. Thanks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The only other feature I would add is it would be cool if it displayed the date that you did tasks. Because for me I like to see how much I get done in a day(I know you can tap on the tasks but I noticed the dates aren't even in order and would just be easier if date was displayed)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very handy app for my reminders all the time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"den er veldig bra"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I wish there were more features to set tasks to be finish this week, or this month, without specifying an exact date"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Missing a lot of features sadly. Tasks within tasks, recurring tasks are poorly handled, location based tasks please? I mean Christ, your other app, Google Keep, has location based ones. I'd love to get reminders for tasks when I arrive at my job, for example."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"falta poder editar las fuentes"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it does just enough. would be good if it could integrate with other apps and link to other tasks. but, it really is just a good enough task list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"No location ability. Only very basic task capability. Cannot create notifications based on location like all the other major mobile companies apps can. Catch up Google or let us attach the assistant to 3rd party apps that actually work."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"does what it says for the free version"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It's very basic and does the bare minimum but I prefer TickTick and I prefer Microsoft ToDo better. And with Microsoft adding CoPilot to it I imagine it'll be that much better. I wish Google would get some focus on their apps and services. Add Bard to this! Add more integrations, add persistent notifications on Android, add badge notifications on iOS/iPadOS, and so on!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"need more options as 3rd party apps . and ui can be improved and optimised Also please add tag options for tasks to organise them inside lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Overall, the app is good,but the notification timing is not accurate when offline, and even sometimes, when the internet is on, don't get timely notified."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It seems Google pays their engineers based on how many times they can switch us, forcefully, from a working app experience to a new broken one. They certainly aren't incentivized to make existing apps better and more robust without breaking things. But this isn't new news."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's simple functional and fast"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Keeps me up to date!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"what a great feature to keep organized and complete task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app. I love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"amo amo amooo es demasiado útil y amo que se sincronice con mi calendario"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I've always used lists to be organized, prepared and on time. However, finding a good digital app to meet my requirements is tough going. Using a Google tasker to work with all my other Google apps just makes sense. I used this Tasks app years ago, but I thought it was discontinued so I looked for something else. Now I see the Tasks app is still available and I'm thrilled to resume using it. Thanks Google."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"VERY good aplication! It helps me so mutch!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Honestly, I expected much more from Google. If you use different lists, you can't see all your tasks at a glance, need to go list by list to see what's pending. Also, there is no way to search for a task! If you don't remember the way you've typed a task, you may end having multiple entries that are alike. Also, there is no way to hide sub-tasks. The only good thing is the integration with google's calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Education"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Well integrated"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Pros: Simple and integrated with Google calendar. Cons: there is no 'All my tasks' and 'Today's tasks'."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"best one but need shedule or some timing notification"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"intuitive UI"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"An app for the watch would be super useful. Also there is no way to copy or export a list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"normal benefits"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The absence of the Search for a word in a task is the usage killer for me. I do not have so much time to go through the whole list in a search for which day I planned something specific. With this functionality it would be my No. 1 to do app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Wish to have an option to right swipe or left swipe to delete. Also wish there was notifications on tasks like events."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Being able to have somewhere to get my tasks arranged goes further, white out and black ink pens strenthen the satisfaction after tapping checkball tab 😄👍🏽😌"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"thik hi hai😅"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like this app.But I think more tools need to be added to this app. like---- 1. task start time 2. Set urgent reminder option 3. more ringtone is needed 4. more perfect features please solve these problems as soon as possible."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Tasks set to repeat forever, will only show in google calendar for about 3 months."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Cool"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Wonderful addition however only get it. If you are going to use Google workspace"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love how simple it is to use and it keeps track of my tasks perfectly. I really love the fact that it separates completed tasks from non-completion so I get that dopamine boost from the crossed off tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Game. Changer."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it reminds me of my tasks. that's all I got."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"ac"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"so far so good, there's no any major issues or anything, tho some features could be optimazed so that's why 4 and not 5 stars. still, it's just me personally finding it annoying. i can't change order of lists, they by default go by creation order which is unpractical when i need to look for ex. at list with important tasks that i just created later, i need to scroll all the way till i find it. also notifications/reminders being weird, sometimes they show up, sometimes not, settings being fine."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Improved with the addition of subtasks, and sheduled tasks but there should be more functionality like setting up a priority matrix, numbering system, dedicated website, etc."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Clear cookies google authenticator"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"life saver."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Very useful, but repeating events frequently don't fire correctly. Instead of reminding me to do a monthly task monthly, it wasn't going to fire again over a year."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The tasks stay silent and hidden in Calendar widget. Ample chance to miss. Biggest drawback. Other than that, a fairly easy to use app but too simple"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"There are a lot of features missing compared to other platforms like Todoist (labels, better organization, nested subtasks, filters, board view within lists/projects, natural text quick add). Either make Google Tasks more complete and better, or give Todoist the ability to integrate with Google Calendar better and visually mark Todoist tasks complete in Google Calendar. If you do this, you could gain a lot of users from Todoist and TickTick. Todoist lacks a calendar. TickTick is poorly designed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Its note bad"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I want to forward e mail to what's up app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"After"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Worst app I don't like any task show.😡"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Would recommend to almost everyone for everything. Does almost everything I want it to do. The most minor of which I'd like the option to not have title case as the default input for task titles. A major one those is I want a tab/board/list that shows all tasks due (today and past) without having to go into the calendar app (I like that one, I use it a lot, but that's gCal not gTasks)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Don't understand why this replaced Reminders, which worked great. Google Tasks regularly doesn't actually remind of my tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Can't find where to turn notifications off. I don't use the app any longer, but I'm still receiving 5+ notifications a day! Very frustrating 😕"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Works and syncs perfectly with other Google prodcuts but as a stand-alone app it's too basic."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I really love this app, however there is something that I really you need to fix us that when the notification of my tasks come they are played with same sound of my phone's notification. In settings there is no option as such to change the notification sound of this app alone. If you add this option, this app will become perfect!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Really Verry Helpful apps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google Task is a fantastic app. I use a program called ""Get Things Done"" (GTD) and it requires you to store information in a quick, reliable place for your reminders. This app is the place to do it. I also store my other GTD lists on the app such as the project list, someday/maybe, etc... and it organizes like a charm."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The app is fine. Very simple, but does the job. Not really anything to get excited about just a basic tasks app. Would give it a 4 but knock it to a 3 because sorting by date only allows you to sort by oldest to newest/furthest in the future. Why can't I sort by date in the other direction?"

The thing is, It's able to use google calendar just fine, and I can see the tasks that I've already created on my phone, except my tablet requires this app in order to view any subtask on the google calendar which really sucks because I made a lot of subtasks..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good and great experience. easy to organize school 🎒 homework"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's a very useful app for everyone who make a plan for doing tasks. it helps you sort and manage your tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"seems pointless if you define a separate app for daily tasks. better to integrate it into the calendar app."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Could you please enable connectivity with others."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Intuitive and smooth. Love that I don't have to pay a fee to use the ""set a reminder"" function."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Need more improvement"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Helps with my adhd lol. 4 stars because could be better, but still awesome."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good for task management except for one thing: If I want to add subtasks under a task I want to repeat daily, I can't. Example: Morning Routine -> Daily Checklist (Repeat Daily) -> Subtasks such as work sesh, train, etc. It would be nice to have this as an option for more freedom an organization. I can work around it, but still frustrating I don't have that as an option. I would look foward to seeing that in an update."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The app is great but there are certain features that will definitely make it better. 1. there should be a choice for more impactful notification / alarm system. 2. there should be a central tab where only all items from all boards that are due for the day will show."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Ok, would be good if drag to another line , lower or above where enabled."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"like the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and efficient 😁"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good but it should have ""shared list"" like Microsoft to do list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's very helpful app, with me is essential for daily use. I would like to contact the developer whether there is a possibility of rearranging the tasks columns. When I add new list automatically it shows up in the end, I prefer to re arrange them"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The one feature that is lacking is taskwise priority, we should be able to set priority levels as high, medium, low or numerical priority levels as 1, 2 .... 10."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Does not send notifications. Defeats the purpose of the app. The interface is nice and simple. Shame it doesn't work."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's a brilliant feature in email application."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Wrost app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It's ok. I would like to move a task to different labels especially when I make a mistake. I have to delete and redo."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Just frustrating to use anymore because it doesn't let you do proper task breakdowns (needs a third level of indentation), and support for location-based reminders was removed. The app also doesn't let you reorder your list of lists, you have to use the web version to do that"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"NICE UI/UX 👍🏽"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The integration between Tasks, Google calendar, and Google assistant has improved so much in the last few years! I fully rely on Tasks to keep track of various lists of things I need to do."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this task app, keeps me on time for appointments and I don't forget things at the grocery store"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Really good app with some excellent integrations with Google Calendar, Google Sheets etc. One suggestion would be to keep the tasks subtask hierarchy intact once a task is marked completed."

There was no way to undo it!!! It is very frustrating and ridiculous when it is so easy to tap the wrong spot. Please fix that!!! You can undo deleting a particular task, so why can you not undo deleting an entire list??? Why is there NO WARNING of what you're about to do???

I was on Todoist but it's too expensive for a couple imo. I've since moved to TickTick and it does most everything I need it to. Still sucks to have to pay for another subscription. I keep hoping Google gets its act together but it's probably just a matter of time before they randomly remove the service rather than improve it."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Simple and good! Probable improvements: 1. Arrangements for using colour tags. 2. Arrangements for declining/undoing the tasks. 3. Arrangements for having shared workspaces with other members. Thanks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"need to improve"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"very limited features, with no attention from developers to improve the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Would love it if you had exact same features in app. Like colors and sharing. Would really love it if its the same layout as Google keep. Also maybe add another option for another notification reminder."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Feature request - shared tasks in google calendar - tasks visible in shared calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very helpful to organize my tasks everyday. I love that you can make multiple lists."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Like this app. Need a version for samsung galaxy watch."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Flawless for me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Didn't think I'd like it, switched over from using tasks in my calendar, which at times was cluttered, but was used to then being there - but the tasks app is nice and clear and simple, very easy to manage, and separate task lists is great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ĺllllelelelelellelelele"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Update: I still love this app and wouldn't know what to do with out it. As someone with Adhd it allows me to stay focused and manage my day to day activities. There are some things I wish the app had. For one, when adding the task, I wish it placed it after each task listed. Usually, when planning your day, you start from the beginning to the end. Each time I add a task, I have to organize it in order. I also wish there was a faster way to delete each task, such as hovering on the task."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Please add natural language processing for date setting 🙏"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is an amazing app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Some of my repeating tasks got hidden on multiple occasions from the Google Tasks app. I thought I was going crazy because I was so sure I set up those tasks but they disappeared. At some point I found those ""missing"" tasks in Google Calendar but at the same time those tasks are not showing up on Google Tasks. They were not lost just that the Google Tasks app sometimes decides to not show your tasks even though they exist. Might as well delete Google Tasks if it is not showing all of my tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesnt work. Notifications dont come through."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful to me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works great for my needs."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Google reminders worked a million times better than this ever has. Thanks, Google, for ""fixing"" something that already worked perfectly fine! Edit (1/2/24): There was an update some time ago, and the reminders started working again. Now it seems with the most recent update, the reminders have stopped almost entirely. Uninstalling for good. I'm done trying to get this app to work. Would give negative stars if I could."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So far so good, if you could please allow the tasks to be searchable, so that I can quickly get to the task that I'm looking for"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"fabulous and lovely"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's really basic, but it helps alot!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It is simple and effective, however still has some issues. Recurring tasks cannot be re-assigned to different list and sorting of tasks with sub-tasks is not possible, as the sub-tasks get mixed up among the tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like this one. thanks Google for catching up on this type of task list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Yeah well I'm looking but I'm not on it but I need to see much more then forward"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like it. Love how you can add subordinate tasks to the checklists. Wish you could remove items without deleting the entire list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I love to see the app being improved and integrated to Google Calendar. I'd love to have shared lists in the future, so that I can have some tasks shared with other users, such as family."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple yet awesome. 🫰❤️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Tasks is such a great app, and the fact that it is linked with Google Calendar makes it even more efficient."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"reasonably good app. can search be added? or linked with Google account?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"best aap"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Needs more focus on the notifications features."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"can't change task categories once tasks are created."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Outstanding"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Google reminders was so much better. Every time I open this app it's logged into a different one of my google accounts. I can't set a default account, meaning if I don't notice and I add a reminder for one Google account, then it switches to another account without my knowledge, I'm not getting the reminder!!! I have to go back and remind MYSELF to check if I have any reminders I may have missed on other accounts due to constant switching. Why can't it just remind you for all accounts"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This product is trash. Like who is / are the Product Manager (s)? It doesn't feel Googly at all. Logo feels like no relation to Google. It feels like requirements gathering hasn't really happened. Google - please invest in making this the best app ever. It's really not that complex. A Noogler could take this on as a intro to Google"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not diligent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google Tasks is a productivity wizard hiding in plain sight. With its minimalist design and straightforward functionality, it's like having a wise elder guiding me through my to-do list. The integration with other Google apps ensures a seamless flow, turning my scattered thoughts into organized action items. The simplicity of creating tasks, setting due dates, and checking off completed items is a joy. It's not just a task manager; it's a productivity muse that keeps me focused and on track."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's a good app and so simple , but I have a problem with subtasks. When I create a subtask, it is also shown in the main task list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good morning sir ji ki."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple, easy to use. Works nicely with Google calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I have no idea why they would replace reminders with tasks. 95% of the time it doesn't send me a notification. Since I didn't have a choice, I downloaded it. This has been ongoing since the change happened months ago"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Foes the job? ẽ?e xdc. Ex.j f"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Can you add the function to sort the customized lists? the tabs on top to be specific; and it will be great if the tasks can be sorted by different customized categories and priorities. ""Starred"" is just too general for tasks. The app needs more work to catch up with the trend of similar apps. It's sad for loyal google users if no one from Google follows up with the comments and needs for the users."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I use the task app daily in combination with Google calendar as invaluable tools that directly affectthe state of my being because my life requires structure. I recommend using this app to all my android friends!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I don't use it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"just started but so far looks great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Seriously lacking a SEARCH FUNCTION. Why on earth is there no Search function, a basic function with any App and one that I've repeatedly requested. Why is this so difficult? Its impossible to find tasks if you have many without a simple search option across all lists and not just within each list. Also there should be a reminder or alarm / notification option for all tasks in other lists and not just in reminders list, otherwise you have to duplicate tasks Come on developers for goodness sake."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I don't get reminders anymore...so I have to use another app, clearly."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"superb hai"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's good to be able to make a shopping and separate task lists for different things."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great I love it.. 😍 Awesome.google rocks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Honestly I can't describe what my life would be like without Google Tasks now that I've introduced it into my life. I use it on a constant basis. I utilize every possible area to make my l much simpler"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"i do not learned of what i used it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please make a new feature of reminding the task with a different notification tone"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"YES. VERY GOOD. ORGANIZATION GO VROOM. IT EVEN NOTIFIES YOU WHEN A TASK IS READY (TIMES CAN BE SET). JUST OVERALL AMAZING APP."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Perfect App for task management"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"handy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"beautiful good apps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"perhaps I'm still just learning how to use this app, but in the morning when I say Good morning to hey Google, it always says ""no tasks for today"" when here is a list I need to do!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"poor replacement"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I believe Google."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"SexyMovies and to the same ways"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice app. doesn't allow to edit though"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"For this to be a Google product I am very disappointed it would be nice if this app had the following features Task with subtasks that can have a repeat date/time, Reminders,Focus mode,Share task to other and possibly color code I'm a big fan of Google products used just about all of them but this one does not meet my needs so unfortunately I got to find something else to better manage my tasks... Google Task I know you can do way better to meet our needs"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I'm him in the eyes as he said come I'm sure not to look away this phone from another account to was billed at photo with unshared item that was before I started a Facebook I deleted my stuff and I put a 200$ Google play prepaid card on my account I have been banned at Google hangouts and website I'm tired of all my loss still can't turn off home icon"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"soooo beautiful app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Hope you add search, at least simple one"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I really dislike the newest update. I prefer keeping the reminders on my notification bar. Currently, when I get multiple reminders, and I tap the corner to expand them, they all get acknowledged and removed from my bar and it takes me into the app. I would like to change the function so you tap to expand the reminder and swipe to remove from my notification. Right now I'm losing all my reminders before I can even read them."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Wish it had more interface options especially in the widget. Would like widget options for: much smaller text, condensed line spacing, transparent background, text color, ability to show completed tasks, a confirmation or long press needed to mark something completed instead of a single tap on the empty circle (to avoid accidentally making something important disappear) Surprisingly the Microsoft todo Android app and widget looks and functions better in most ways."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy to navigate and created a much needed schedule of my day."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"PLEASE ADD A BUTTON TO THE WIDGET TO OPEN THE APP"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"set a reminder but it didn't remind me."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works similar to minimalist to-do on my iPhone which is fantastic"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"best"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Basic features only. Don't have basic options like move and arrange tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I used to be an iPhone user with Structured. Perfect app... for IOS. They don't keep it up to date for Android. This combined with Google Calendar is an excellent alternative though!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I miss having the reminder option tho"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"very easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very handy and highly functional- simple yet effective."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"تطبيق رائع ولكن نرجو دعم اللغة العربية بشكل كبير بحيث تبدأ من يمين السطر وشكراً"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Fabulous for me to stay organised and informed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I recommend it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app is pointless as Google Keep has all the same functionality + more. The only thing that Keep doesn't have that this does is sub tasks. Why do you keep doing this Google? Separate apps for single features. It's like Android Pay/Google Wallet, Allo/Duo/Hangout all over again. Planned to fail and go to the Google graveyard."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I have tried severally but I don't understand why I won't have an alarm ring to it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I'm not sure if it's purpose"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Love this account"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"My Google Assistant doesn't work well with this app. If I ask to put it on a specific list that I created in Tasks. It puts it in my calendar as something to do. I don't really understand how to work this. The only way I found to add to specific lists is the manually go in Tasks and choose the list I want them entry task. It even puts my request in Google Keep but not in my specific Tasks list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Decent task manager. I like the connection to google calendar. However, maybe add labels/categories to tasks to help group and separate them. Also, possibly make a view where you can see all tasks across lists."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The installation of this app is necessary to get reminder notifications on Pixel Watch... But that's not something Google has ever said. Thanks google... makes a lot of sense"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Keeps me organized. I like that I can add subtasks and categories."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Just started using this app & so far I like the simplicity and usability, however I have 2 requests for improvement. First, would like to be able to reorganize the order of the list categories. Secondly, would like to be able to recognize the order of tasks in the starred list. It would also be helpful to select a tab that just shows tasks that are dated for the current day."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Kindly provide option to attach files in the task. And also to change default option to create new task on touching the calendar on Android phone. Allow multiple reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Dude fix the app 🤣 it doesn't send a single sound or vibration or anything for every single task! Pathetic."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminds me of tasks at any time it wants."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"RATAN 🇧🇩🥀🥀"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple, easy and fast"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good 4 u"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simply perfect"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"widget tends to get stuck in a past state, upcoming tasks not shown"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Deleting all completed tasks now brings recurring tasks back to the list instead of leaving them completed until the day they are supposed to reoccur. Still needs ability to collapse subtask."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Still much left to improve, first: you can snooze a task from a notification bar, second: task being sorted only by date, it should be by date and time in a single day. Third: all of a sudden, the app shows all the tasks in a day in notifications!! It should only show a particular task which has reached its time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome God"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's okay"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"No support for sharing tasks with others. This app has the chance to be incredible if you could share tasks and it could link with Google calendar. But... It doesn't. I'll continue using Microsoft TODO until they support this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"When I written a big task/sentence, it doesn't show me the full sentence in my home screen widget. Very disappointed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"absolutely very helpfull i love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"UI not so intuitive"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I have a memory problem and rely heavily on this app. since it allows you to create your own categories you can use it to remember literally everything."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"fairly basic"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"lists could be organized better with more options"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"working good so far"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"There has been good improvement from my last review and widgets has been also added as was requested. I would like to have feature of copying/moving task items in between groups/list so that I don't have to to it manually, this would be nice to have."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I wish I had used this app long ago. VERY easy to use and I like all the features avail."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I'M CEO Miss president of the company"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"indispensable planning tool"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Apparently, I can't set tasks with subtasks as recurring tasks. 😐 What's the deal with that? 😑 Would be great if I can set it to recur whenever I need to regardless if they have subtasks or not. Also would be great if it's more integrated in the Google Calendar app, so that I can also see the subtasks there as well. LOL I got an idea... Why don't this app and the Google Calendar app just merge together? 😂"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Decent app for reminders but if you dismiss notifications, the reminder disappears as well. The app remains unchecked in the app, but if you don't check the app regularly (and why would you), your tasks may end up out of sight, out of mind. Forgotten more than a few things that way, for an app that's supposed to remind you of things"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and effective for my forgetful nature. I use Google voice to set all my reminders and tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Water excellent app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google tasks is a great app to go with trust me and Google needs are the only way I choose to go"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I really like using this app it works good every time I use it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"there are definitely worse out there"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Not a replacement for reminders. No location reminders. Missing what I used to have"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Links into your Gmail Tasks and allows you to change the list order and tab over entries for a sub list. I research tasks apps a while back and this one was the best one I found."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"op"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"There is no ability to add labels nor tags. It's neither possible to set up reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I think it need more updates"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"One problem is that you cannot see all the taskss at once and you have to see the taskss in your group. Another weakness is that you cannot add attachments (photos, etc.) to the tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's helpful and simple. Good to be synced with other devices. But once you start categorizing and making different lists the order of lists will be permanent!!!!!!! There is no option to categorize lists."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"WOW! This app is truly amazing💖! It's BY FAR the best productivity app here, AND, it's FREE! NO awful ads or fees! Having ADHD I need a simple, quick, and easily accessible place to mind dump and organize all my to-dos, to-gos & to-gets into detailed lists. I've tried so many apps, even paid versions and this is by far the best. It's so strangely basic, but in a good way. The one thing I'd add is a few options to personalize, so I can make it pretty💟😉🌺 or at least pink. GO INSTALL IT NOW!😄"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"My favorite application for keeping whole things remember, no ads. No many features, just keeping it simple & cool, that's I want. Love ❤ this app"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Bank of America has been on my account chase Bank 🏦🏦 All can get paid in Bitcoin"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It would be better if I can check the date of when I made the task and a way to check the subtask's description when I am in the task window because I need to go back to the main list of the tasks in order to check them. Also one more layer of subtasks for the current subtasks feature. Overall this tool is pretty simple and easy to operate 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Definitely the best To Do app out there!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Nice, but it needs more attention on tab part, it's not too much easy to use, but it's a must use app. As an user I'm satisfied"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"For something developed by Google, this app really makes an exception at being ""it just works"". The design is minimalist, all the essential features are there but it lacks the ""master list to sub-list feature"" that MS To-Do has which could make it flawless."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It might be better than I'm giving it credit just hasn't been that effective I'm possibly just not using it correctly."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I want to know, is it possible to use this app in pixel watches?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good, & useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"just figuring this out..some were 2 years ago"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy and simple to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Book post jatt#@!?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"1) Please add more options like Eisenhower matrix (to categorize our tasks), pomodoro, etc. Your rationale might be ""our app is simple and more simple is better,"" but you can add these kinds of features and let the user choose want to use them or not in the setting. 2) please add Persian calendar (solar hijri)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Tasks now supports repeated reminders. I can finally consider this as a viable replacement to the TODO app I'm using. However, I'd still like see some features which I think will be a good overall addition: (1) Let me choose a different notification sound, so that I can tell apart. (2) Make the list rendering compact. Currently takes too much vertical space. (3) Offer a snooze button on the task notification for (say, for 15 mins/1hr). (4) Searching tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Perfectly ✅👍👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I don't know why Google got rid of the reminders in the calendar and started using tasks. I hate not having everything all in one place 😑"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Would like to have a second type of task that, once marked as completed, would not reappear. This would be ideal for tasks that are one time, non-repeating. Once marked completed, they would not remind again. Reminders would appear at the selected frequency until marked completed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"🥶 Tasks have become obsolete and will probably get abandoned by Google, much like numerous other products and features in the past. The ads will never be overlooked by Google; 2-3 columns per row, for you and your peripheral vision. 🤣"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and effective."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best👍👌"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I think it's best for anyone who wants to add reminders & have someone to remember you when something's up. Overall good, but could've add some more options to change the label orders & few different colors to customize the reminders. But still it's so good when it comes to Android, specially because of the live syncing with Google Assistant & other Google apps such as calenders, etc. Looking forward to see those little changes, Recommended."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Please add the ability to copy a list to text. Also would be great if I could reorder items on the widget."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Notifications are delayed. I set a task, for example, at 10:30 am & there is no notification until I either move my phone or another app's notification goes off OR I go into the task app & then the notifications start. This started about 2 to 3 weeks ago. It shows the time of the notification, for this example 10:30 am but won't alert me to the tasks at that time. Very annoying."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great organizer"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Worst. Reminders doesn't work,no alarm. Missed calling friend on b day"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"My starred tasks reset after just one day, which is frustrating because it's the only way to see a list of tasks combined across lists. I've had glitches where the specific time per task resets, making the order by date function useless when I'd need it most. While the app has a refresh button, the widget does not, so if it is showing up incorrectly there's no way of controlling that. Its also silly to not allow recurring tasks for ones with subtasks too."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"probably grounds removed class area CODE"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not sending notification recently even notification is enabled, background activity for this app ensure and auto start for this app enabled."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The app generally works pretty well. However, some reminders I set will inexplicably appear on my phone up to two hours AFTER the reminder time I set. Having reminders for time-sensitive tasks appear late is obviously frustrating, and it undermines one of the key functions of the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I wish there was some sort of motivation; maybe graphs."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Awkward, not a great UI, can't assign tasks to others or really organize in any way. It serves such an important function but feels like an afterthought from a supposedly first rate company."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helpful ☺️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Works well, not a lot of add-ins or other options to improve layout& fonts, but no lagging and easy to sync. The lists are a good feature, but they are too bland; as well there is currently no simple one touch (or five) method to cross over a Task from an inaccurate Heading. But it's very thorough and reliable. Certainly."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"very good app for being self discipline and consistent towards your work"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Oh man! This app made me a self-made millionaire, I finally managed to do my projects on time and stay hard!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The tasks widget does not work on Work Profile"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I love it! But ... I have a heap of different lists and checklists. I recently discovered there is no way to export the lists, say into a spreadsheet or into Google sheets. Can you add this function? Then it would be 5 stars. Thanks"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I wish ""Today"" tab is configured to only show those tasks with date set for the current date. Then ""overdue"", ""outstanding"" and ""tomorrow"" tabs held their respective tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good aap."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"For repeat tasks, after ticking the next schedule task is not appeariny"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"After setting the title & task on a particular day, after i say the time it automatically sets the task incorrectly on the next day. Please work on this bug."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"You can undo completing a (completed) task, add details, repeat and add a list of sub-tasks on tasks — and arrange (sort) lists of tasks, by date (past/today/no date), starred ★/no star ☆, your order. You can create shared tasks in Chat/Docs and use in the Google apps."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The calendar does not comply with my phone's settings as Monday is my first day of the week. Reminders was better. Having the ability to select to push a reminder to tomorrow is easier and faster in reminders app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not very user-friendly"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, good job"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy reminders with Google home integration"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Notifications rarely work, cannot be relied on. Do yourselves a favor and uninstall tasks and just use calendar if you value actually getting your reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So easy 😄 best task complete app 🙌🏻"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"simpme but functional"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I wish to can add comments in each subtask or principal task, for determining the solution of each task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"need to add automated due date and time from natural language. Also need to be able to automatically show all tasks due today as opposed to having to star them. would be great if an audible notification could be added by user."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please add an end time . It's very important."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"If you are looking for a simple easy to use tasks manager with very minimal features & customization options then Google Tasks might be perfect for you.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Kind of tough to use *for me* without the ability to create reminders or notifications for a task separate from the (recurring or singular) deadline(s). If I have a task due at the end of the month and want a weekly reminder to complete this, there's no way to accomplish that. Just gotta open tasks every day and check."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The good is that it is simple. The bad: no customization, workflow could be much better (see GTasks)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"well I downloaded this app to remind myself the things I'm bound to do , but i am not receiving any kind of notifications, and eventually I always miss my daily shedule because of no notifications , I tried to check if there's any issue with my mobile but, it is the application, I think you should fix this issue..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"superb app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It is just a notification. If there is any option to custom ringtone, it would have been great. The basic and main feature is not there."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works well, not much to say. Very lightweight app - appreciate it and use it daily."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"no date stamp when tasks are marked completed.. really?!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"We should not think of Google Tasks as a standalone task manager. It is designed to work hand and glove with Gmail and Google Calendar. When used as it was created nothing comes close to its convenience and efficiency."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Useful as long as you are not a sloth."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I absolutely love setting reminders just TO NOT EVER GET THEM. WHAT HAPPENED??????? DUMPSTER JUICE APP"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's alright... But could do with some improvements. For example, why is there no start-end option so that you can time-block tasks into the Google calendar? It would also be good to be able to leave comments on tasks. It feels like it goes so far but not all the way to challenge Appa like Todoist or Any.do. Which is a shame."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I'm happy to have the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"need many improvements"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app for keeping track of small tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't sent reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It forgets to remind me things 🤡"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good one"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I am using this app from long time, found very very useful, very handy for quick notes"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It basically helps with what I need to do. Even while I'm not in school"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"تطبيق رائع"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"effective and succinct."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"i hope safe it's"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Sometimes the app bugs out, like not reminding you of a task for every 2 days and instead reminds you every day. But the app is perfectly fine and usable most of the time. I've got a bunch of important tasks that show up right on the dot every single time without issues. I'm glad this app is free AND ad-free."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"يحتاج بعض الحماس بالنسبة لاشخاص اخرين لكي ينضمو معنا الى التطبيق"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Working well, so far. I like that I can add to tasks and lists I'm Google Keep using the assistant. It has made our family ""chore wheel"" a thing of the past."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Recently stopped working and app restarts don't solve the problem. The only reminders that appear are ones set prior to the latest update. New reminders randomly dissappear from list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"overall a good app but there could be so many more options added."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app should not exist."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Baf"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helps me keep track of game materials etc etc"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No type of ""jump to today"" button or any type of quickly changing the date whatsoever without tapping through month after month"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"On"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The mobile app is fine, but the integration ecosystem with other Google products is painful. The Google Assistant cannot proceed with creating a task without filling in a form verbally, and then it gets it wrong, every time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Love this new addition, if your anything like me and think you can remember past three things on your todo list. And realize after forgetting. Lol well this app is gor you simple well layed out clear and easy setup."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I don't know what Google Tasks really does so I doubt if I I ever use it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Uninstalling because... No search option & no font size adjustment.. All other is fine"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"place help me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Just terrible, I can't even share data, lists, change the order of my lists, and have no message platform. It would be useful if this app was more like Google Photos"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"still getting use to using. more feedback next time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for Getting Things Done. I really love it and use it daily with different timing horizons. Missing features are the following: Why can I not search on the tasks? Why can I not attach files to a task? Why can I not dictate the tasks? Why can't I make it full screen or at least bigger in a browser on a Windows laptop?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"simple and easy. not many features though"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"worked better before the changes made"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this is the best application for management of personal affairs."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"There is no Search option"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This app helps me try to keep track of my tasks & things I like to save that inspire or teach me something that I can go back to! I just wish it was more simple & already had some of the daily & weekly tasks that are important in life already added to it & suggestions like items needed on a grocery list or important morning & night routines that would be so hekpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"amazing app but, please. please. please add color coding for tasks to appear on callender each task with different color"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very Durable App, but needs to work on flexibility of changing routines. I had 30 List and I had to manually delete them one by one. And the UI was slow. Overall I am satisfied except for the lack of more options on flexibility."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Love all things Google but this app needs to be improved. There's a lot of good ideas inside the comment section. I would like to add that it needs to be able to make a sound (notification sounds) not just vibrate and show up on the screen."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it's simples, integrated and easy. it's minimalistic and fancy, but NEED to be add a task management basic feature: PRIORITY LEVELS"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The app is inconsistent when sending reminders. One day it will send a notification, the next day it won't. Opening up the app will send a reminder, even if it's past the set time"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So far, after a bit of time figuring out how to use it, I like it a lot. I am however already ready for the next big UI upgrade, whenever that may be."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Too basic"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Thank your team for developing dark themes and widget. I love them so much. But I suggest that the widget should have a sort-by feature. The current widget only shows the task list by sort-by-my-order (while I am using sort-by-date in the app). I also wish that you integrated Tasks into the Google Calendar app to display tasks on the timeline like on Google Calendar web."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy and useful app. Integrated with Android is essential."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy to use and lots of feature"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I wish i could attach picture on to do list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Everything is perfect. It should have an option of alarm at the given time like a phone alarm rings. Secondly it should have a search tool to search data from all the tasks. If one wants to find a mobile number, he has to go into calender and do all the stuff. Search tool is actually very necessary and alarm would add more one feature."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Trash...Bring Back the To Do List! I don't need ALL my ""tasks"" for the day listed on my calendar widget, but that's the only option other than this trash app if I want my tasks tied to my Google Calendar. Tasks with times don't alert on time. I have to open the app THEN it alerts me. NOT HELPFUL, GOOGLE!! Tasks is garbage."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Super helpful on keeping me up to speed with my assignments & tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reviewers gawt it rite!!!! Worthless app?!!?!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good, but what would make this app perfect would be if they made it so all your lists in Google Tasks would show up in Google Keep as a checkbox list (somewhere, or maybe with a setting enabled), so you could use both apps or just either app, and still get the benefits of both."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Sync of Google is always the best. but in this app Google must work more.

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I shouldn't have had to download an extra app just to get my reminder notifications again. Update: Reminders/tasks are not showing notifications at all. Saying ""remind me..."" does not show a notification at all. The whole point of the application has become pointless and useless."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's almost perfect but sometimes it doesn't notify me. It's really important that I get these notifications because I'm very forgetful and these remind me to do things like feed my dog. Might be an issue with my phone (Note 10+) but it's a big issue."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like that it sync's with cloud so I can work from desktop too. I like that you can give items alarms. I wish when you check an item off, it didn't disappear but I use the stars instead to function that way."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great simple task app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"This app won't let you create a list with sub tasks that repeats weekly, love how it's setup and how easy it is to use but that was a massive requirement for me and I'm sure for others"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This task application is awesome because you can add emails as a task and also add your own personal custom items as a task.

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Seems to do job,not sure?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app would be great, but it's missing such a key feature it's hard to give it a real rating. Please make tasks and task lists sharable. For a company with so much focus on collaboration as a means to make information useful... this is really missing the bill."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very essential"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Used this app before Google bought it out is was just an app to make lists now its a task app and is useless to makes lists with. Uninstalling."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works great for events and things"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Very helpful!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The app isn't popping up reminders. I've double checked all settings, and notifications are on, yet the app won't give a notification of the reminder."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"You can still improve on it. it'll be much better if it deletes a task with a swap to the right. and it has a pinning option📌"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Looks like a great replacement for my previous home screen to-do widget so far, plus it has google assistant and stiff to make things easier. I'd love the ability to be able to make the widget have a semi transparent background, so I can see my wallpaper still.

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"OK...."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"According to google, this is the pixel idea of reminders, but the notification shows up on your screen for a few seconds and disappears. If you're not sitting by your phone waiting to be reminded, you will have to go search for your reminder which is not exactly how reminders work. On my galaxy, they stayed there until they were checked off, marked completed, or snoozed for 5 minutes to an hour later. Definitely some updates needed here."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Potentially this could be a great app, but the fact that you can't collapse sub tasks is terrible. All you end up with a massive long list of tasks on a screen. I wonder whether the developers of this app ever actually use it themselves?"

Closest it got was a push notif at midnight for a 23:30 reminder that was by then useless. Uninstalled. ///// This was unnecessary. Reminders through Assistant worked great before this mess. Now I set reminders and get reminded about maybe 10% of them, if that. All notif settings are on but it doesn't matter. Now I have to find a reliable reminder system again."

Useful when you absolutely need in just this one time, cant imagine using this as a long term solution."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"my words cannot express Tasks is the best application it make my task easy to complete"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"if we could take tasks from one list section to another it would be cherry on top. Or add a horizontal line in the tasks as a separator."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Utterly useless.. can't set a task for a location."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very handy. Very simple. Only thing missing is a search function but if you allow your calendar to see the tasks then you can search from your calendar app. Nice simple widget too."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Rescheduled events are copied in calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Your new reminder app does not work!!! With Assistant I always received my reminders. Don't not try to fix what ain't broke!!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"just started using the app. I really like that when you make a list, under a title, you can move the list items around for what to do in order or priority . this is very very helpful vs hand writing ...I also like you can have sublists. I would like to be be able to reorder the items in the sublist too. is there a way? so far very helpful and easier to use than a task list on my calendar . Can this dovetail with the Google calendar when I enter a date for a task?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not getting any alerts... It's quite annoying when I rely on them for basic stuff."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"My parsnal not sharing file"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I really like this app, it's easy to create and manage tasks and the integration with my Google calendar is fantastic"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"the notifications should not be silent. Maybe an optional alarm could be added. Overall unusual to use, a bit difficult to manage, and a bit difficult to figure out.. Not horrible, but not exactly good..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is simple but can be powerful for you to use if added to your daily life to remind you of important things if you are like me and forget things this is good just don't forget to use it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I am still trying to get my account workin"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminders are not taks"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"as a first year high-schooler, I have a hard time keeping track of my tasks and to-dos. as I am in fact super picky, it is quite hard but then my dad suggested this app. had been really helpful and minimalistic. literal high school goals 🙌"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"could be so much better, atleast add some features like ability to add a file(if not that just a photo then) to the task, info that tells when the task was added, ability to move task to other lists, sub tasks, pre reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"best app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"could have been further made it student friendly for the purpose of revision with proper schedule.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love it. Simple and effective."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"not recieveing my google photos on my phone or emails this app keep showing on my phone but I can't uninstall it or access it"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"First time using, guess we will see tomorrow when I go to complete my tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I used to love setting reminders but ever since google migrated to ""tasks"" my reminders never come through at the right time if they come through at all. I can't rely on this app at all. It is terrible!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it more then Microsoft"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Thank"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I spent hours making a daily morning and night routine, I forgot to add the time on each task so I had to delete all of them and then redo all of them with the time. Why can't I edit an item once it's been created? And secondly, why can't I have reoccurring subtasks that would make everything so much easier."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"This isn't as intuitive as I thought it would be. I thought I'd be able to create multiple tasks in the same list and then have the option to add subtasks if applicable. If I create a list for the day, I can only put one item on the list and then the other activities have to go in the subtasks section. It's just not as helpful as I thought it would be. I'll try a different app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"it deos not remind you so don't use it guys"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"very organized and very private. but also available for shipping. would recommend to couples and familys"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Retarded app. Can't select/copy/delete or move items between lists. Can't export or share lists. These are serious gaps that are all standard features for any app. Please add these abilities!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I would rate it 5 but it lacks a basic function, it won't let you select multiple tasks to move between lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"its simplicity"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good application"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good for my task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I never seen to get notifications for my reminders. Really sucks."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"does the job"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"HALPING ENHANCEMENT CAN BE ADDED BUT THAT'S UNLIMITED TO THINK ABOUT BUT EVERYTHING CANNOT BE COVERED IN THIS SMALL BUT HELPFULL APP."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Flawless App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Cant color code task lists/Bring reminders back!!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"There isn't much you can do with this app. You can't even create a sticky with a checking list unlike the web version. This is simply just a reminders app and could have been so much more. What a waste of time and data."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"This is very basic, and is fairly unintuitive. It also converts any reminders you already have in your calendar into its own 'Task' format as soon as you open it for the first time, which isn't great. Not a great app, to be honest, with some fairly strange design decisions."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Generally quite good. Just a few UI improvements and perhaps an historical reporting feature would be nice."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"perfect except can not share tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Prince Sverre of Norway 🇳🇴 birthday 🎂"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it's a good app to keep up with your tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Mostly the assistant integration could be better. Nothing fancy here."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Please add a search feature also for tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Terrible app never reminds me on time always late with reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use tool for managing tasks and to do items. I like that it is integrated with Google calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"assistant randomly works. so unreliable"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Handy,everything you need"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"task interface does not obey normal rules for multi-select etc"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Really brilliant strategy from Google to make the Google app such a useless heap of garbage that I have to download the ""tasks"" app just to use what was once a standard feature!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I'm still bitter that Reminders in Google Calendar all became Tasks cause they had different uses and Tasks don't cover all that Reminders were. But since we have only Tasks now, it's ok and here are what I would suggest: Extras that would be lovely: colour coding for categories, priority status (stars or some kind of ranking). Love the clean design Love subtasks Love that I can check them off with a tap of the circle"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The added Task app along with your calendar, there is no way you can miss completing your daily ""do's"""
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"nice of this tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Dog show was funny"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very simple and effectiveness UI"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The app is good, I replaced Todoist with it because of the integrations it has with Gmail and Calendar. I really miss some things though that are important for my productivity: - Allow filtering by date, so I don't feel overwhelmed seeing future tasks - A version for Pixel Watch; How can Todoist and other apps have a version and Google Tasks itself doesn't have it? - A Chrome extension; Sometimes I'm browsing and working on stuff and just want to quickly view tasks without havin' to open Gmail"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's ok and clean but hey Google you really REALLY need an option for an audio alarm/notification to alert the user so the can hear the alarm to remind them of the task especially if it is for a certain time. A silent notification is basically pointless So add an audio ringtone alert alarm notification options of some sort when you set a time Thank You"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It is a very easy tool for my very hectic life."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Small popup instead of an alarm"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not as useful as the previous reminder function in Google calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is super simple and easy to use. The notification works like a charm and the app runs smoothly even on my almost 4 years old device. Keep up the good work 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Need to be more organised. Should be able to show according to date order."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Can you add a function that users can upload a attachment sth"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Finally using this app. I'm going to try."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to access and retrieve information"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Add tasks with attachments . I want see my tasks with pictures or videos"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I hate that the tasks don't pop up at the time I set them for! If I wanted a reminder to call someone at 11:00 pm, I would set it for 11! A 2:00 reminder that doesn't show up until 11:00 is useless and aggravating. I miss the old calendar reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"amazing for people who backpack! You can easily marked off what you have ready to go, and when it's marked off it doesn't disappear, so it's not like you're making a whole new list again 🤝"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it took awhile but once I finished my 1st list it was easy start small lists 1st"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"interface is clear and easy to use but adding details is a little unintuitive"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Indeed a great app. Really Helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Liking Tasks more than ever with the full screen layout from calendar. I'd love to see a ""make google doc"" function that put a link to the doc into the task (like when you drag a Gmail email into the tasks sidebar)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"good other than you need a better way of adding items. Too many steps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very helpful with planning"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works. no nonsense."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Amazing, just what a was looking for. Thank you."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Idk what the reminder is for? I had tasks assigned google cal is garbage too, you've to manually set to even set a reminder notification otherwise you have to go open the apps to see whats pending. Its awful and garbage, doesn't serve the purpose, whats the point of reminders? I could do this thing well in a notes app then. And even if it has to be this way there should be a functionality for an alarm type reminder."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like the simplicity. The Task app now displays items separately from calendar appointments and events. Entries are color-coded. Reminders keep popping up until you mark them ""Done."""
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I use this app for my daily and weekly tasks. Initially the daily tasks would trigger notifications as soon as I started using my phone in the morning. Now it triggers at 1600. I tried adjusting the daily tasks to trigger at 0900. I see that the time is there, saved correctly, and poof, no more time allocated to the task the moment I close and reopen the app. Not very cool. And it used to work so well. Bummer"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"5 star"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Easy to use, but limited options. Also I find the notifications unreliable, sometimes they appear sometimes they don't."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful to be able to sync tasks with Gmail and all my android devices. simple and efficient"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great, easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps me remember to get the tasks I need to do for the day done:)!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"easy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I do not receive notifications of tasks. All. Permissions are allowed and alarm & notification are turned on in advance. Disappointing :("
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is actually very helpful for students. I am able to organize all my assignment works and homework. Every student must give a try to this app👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Hate this app. I'm so angry that Google will not sync with my When. Do app which is much, much better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Needs more customisation. Borrow from Microsoft To Do."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is part of my business tools"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"As a person who always needs a reminder this app Is amazing. No excuses for Forgetting any reminders."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Not crazy about the UX. I enjoyed using google keep more."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Not really useful, but high quality app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"really good tool"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Amazing, while it worked. Now, absolute garbage and no concerns are being addressed. Tasks & reminders no longer push through, despite all of the notifications being on in settings! Have to go into the app to get timed reminders!!!! Missed out on several time sensitive issues before I realized it wasn't serving its (only) purpose for me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's really snappy, with an easy to use interface. It actually has pretty good feature coverage, including timed tasks, sub-tasks, and task descriptions. However, it could benefit from task tagging, or some sort of support for task organization beyond just lists and sub-tasks. Location-based reminders would be clutch too. Honestly, if they could just merge Google Keep and this app somehow, that would be amazing."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't give a notification, so I don't get reminded."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple to do list app better than others"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"absolutely well done 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"👍🧬🫶"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Pretty lame. No search-functionality etc... If I were Google, I'd be ashamed for this app!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Though it's really good and helpful but I feel it could be made more interesting and attractive with some more basic features."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Sharing a task or task list would be awesome."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This app is useful just make sure you put it on your home screen as widget."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I think you very much."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"confusing Sunday as 1st day of week and no settings to change this. Normal people have Monday as 1st day."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Very basic. Wish it had voice support to set tasks and reminders. Also, undone reminders are easily lost. But it does the basic job of pinging your phone at a certain time okay."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No Service..not happy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Notification are not working!! Some days the notification are not working at all, I have missed so many already due to this issue. Only when you opening the tasks app, the notification are starting to appear again, and few days later again no notification. This is ridiculous, need to fix this issue asap! Would give 0 stars if was possible."

Pueden implementar la opción de etiquetas para así dividir el contenido."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Google Tasks inability to set reminders based on a specific number of days after creating a task poses a challenge for managing tasks that require reminders after a fixed interval, such as package expiration dates or recurring events. Currently, users can only set reminders for specific dates, which isn't always practical. Google Tasks should implement a feature that allows users to set RECURRING REMINDERS based on a specific number of days after creating a task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Make widget transparent background."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"App does not work! Please bring back calendar reminders... Calendar reminders worked great. Loved having the ability to tell google to remind me to do something and right on time, id get a reminder. ""Tasks"" only works if the app is open. If the app is not open, you wont get the reminder which makes the entire app useless. Perhaps we need another app to remind us to open the tasks app so we can get the reminders? If it aint broke, don't fix it!! But alas, google has tried to ""fix"" it broke it"

If there's a way to do it you should make it about a hundred times easier."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Need a alarm tone as well if we have phone ib our pockets so that we can know what's the thing is left to do."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Overall, ok. But Google missed an important feature to club all upcoming due tasks on one page, just like My Day feature of Microsoft To Do app. Currently, I need to keep jumping from one list to another or rely on phone notifications or the calendar app. Imagine how stupid it is by design that one needs to use another app to track tasks created in an app dedicated to the task management."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Would ave given tis a 5 star however, I understand it is a to-do list and would like to see an option were I can share an item with a team member, where that task concerns my team."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Love the simplicity and synchronization. It's everything I need except for one thing. Adding the option for location based tasks would be great. I don't really like using location reminders in keep as I've faced a lot of bugs with it. Bug: Frequently send notifications hours later. app was never put to sleep and I use it daily so not sure why it's inconsistent. sometimes it works other times it don't . I use it to ensure I take my medication and often time I don't get notified"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Need to be able to sort alphabetically!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Easy to use, you can create multiple lists, edit entries, keep history of tasks done: 5 stars to the app; BUT, is up to you to be organized, rely on the app for what you need to do, do proper follow up, etc. so it'll be 5 stars for you."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good design"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The way I sort the tasks get reset every time I open the app. It's annoying! Also, I don't always get notifications/reminders. It's broken. It doesn't send me notifications of my reminders anymore ever since they were moved to Tasks."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like Tasks but is there a way you can add reminders that I can pick a date and time to remind me to do them? That is the only thing that is missing. I like that it connects to Google Calender."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy to use and simple interface. pushes notifications to my phone and integrates with my Google ecosystem flawlessly"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love how this is integrated into Gmail app.. I love setting task right from Gmail"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works out great for me and my list,and reminders 😀"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy and effective 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"handy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Function is great 👍 but I like to colour theme background like wise Google note"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good and useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"could work much better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"¿Por qué motivo no puedo crear una tarea que se repita diariamente y que a la vez contenga otras sub-tareas? me parece absurdo y más considerando que todas las aplicaciones similares de la competencia incorporan esta función."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Does not notify me when the task date and time occur. Notification settings all on in all and phone settings. What's the point of a reminder of it doesn't alert a reminder?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app. Does what it says it does!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, even for disorganised ppl like me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Jeihm"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"usefulapps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I was finding it really useful that I could tell my Google Assistant to remind me something and then I can visually see it which day in my calendar it was on as I have a Google calendar widget. Now, I no longer see when my reminder is for a certain date and have to get into the habit of opening the tasks app and find it through a list view. This is going backwards in usefulness. I would like to see all my reminders on my calendars"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helpful in a lot of ways"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"no support for Google speaker to have this notification"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Pretty great. I like tasks and notes"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"How about support for natural language when adding new task?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I have a Motorola phone I want my gmail acount"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Need to have the ability to reduce the large spacing between lines by pin-zooming in and out so the user can see more. Also, it would be great if the date and time attested to a task can be made concise. Lastly, instead of a big star on the right hand side, it could be more concise with just a tiny bubble or anything that just does not take this much space. thanks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Can't sync/share task lists with other accounts. Makes no sense in adding the email ID to the task notification. Why can't I edit when do events repeat once I've set a repeated schedule. If I cancel a repetition in the task, it grays out the cancellation and does not allow editing it or creating a new repeated schedule for that task. That task has to be created from a scratch."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Hi devs, could you add feature ""remind task when I arrive at the location around the time (hour, 7-8am)"". Sorry for bad english. I hope you understand"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"not good way to handle things"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"not intuitive. can't even figure out how to get a reminder notification"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Well designed, like this game."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I haven't used it yet."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Nice task list. Wish it could set alarms or reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"My previous 5 star rating was premature. The reschedule feature is awesome, but its only shown up once. Why have such a terrible UI with constant unpredictable and unreliable changes?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"why can't I share share a list. why can't I copy a list to clip board to share with others?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The app is trash . I think it needs me to reminder it to reminder me of tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I think I would be lost without it, because I have so much I have to do, with this app I prioritize what I need to do first!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Удобное приложение для трекинга задачь, осталось их записывать только туда."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"there is no reminder to remind me 30 minutes before."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It integrates with the Google workspace seamlessly. Able to make taskable lists from mails received. Integrates with calendar etc. An easy to get used to diary replacement"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"There should be an option for filtering out today's task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't allow app to remind you ahead of the time and date of reminder"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good for productivity"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I miss location-based reminders..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Does lots well but with all Google's resources, could do a few simple things better, easily. see Outlook."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"reminders do not always come on"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"way less functional than the assistant based app. reminders don't show up at the scheduled times if ever."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I use Google often to find definitions and information about many different topics."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Keep me on time for my medication and things I need to do"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"there's no option to make a sound when it's a reminder"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I can't figure how to add to or subtract tasks, yet."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I love it overall. I wish for 2 things. You can put pictures. And that you can also set times and dates for sub-tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"google keep exist"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great for keeping a log of what I've done 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Having hard time sending, my reply confirm reply messages"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's more than a simple task list. Hope we can change colour scheme of the task to make it more appealing and refreshing look."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"🤍💚🤍Nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Very buggy. Reminders asked for future dates get set for tomorrow. Really bad change from the old reminders tool."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good grocery list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy and guided"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I set a reminder with a voice command but I never know if it's going to remind me. Alarms and reminders are allowed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"introduce some new feature and improve sub task list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"¹kmmmmmm.immmmj"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great reminder for things that need to be done."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not as user friendly as I would've expected, disappointed. Keeps repeating same stuff, even after ""checked off"" list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome thanks best decision-making."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Just something I didn't want to forget"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Missing search function."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good. Three features missing: Urgence & importance, Today's tasks, Colors for lists."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple but customizable"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I'd like to have the possibility to modify the single task in recurring tasks without modifying the series, which is possible via laptop (via Google calendar) but not via mobile app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The regular notes in mi phone has better option than this app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I want to be able to see a list of missed tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"my 2 Peter here wither dad son"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Super easy to use!! Love it!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent hack"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's a very useful application for your reminders. But, it would be super cool if you could add images to the tasks like keep notes."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"great. I'd like to be able to rearrange the lists."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"the repeat option has first weekday of the month option is the reason I like it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple, intuitive, functional. Does what it supposed to and that's it. What more could you want."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this feature is wonderful. added bonus to all the Google things that help my day go smoothly."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's a great way to organize our to-do items and stay on top of what really matters."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Hopefull"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome tool for creating new habits!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"nice work, it's helpful to remember things."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"All things are good but there one problem when i set tasks it's sub tasks then there no option tasks repeat timer why??"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Push notifications do not seem to work at all"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best habit app ever. Simply awesome!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"since a couple of days reminders for tasks don't pop up at all or being too late."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The application operates seamlessly, and its user interface is also nice. But, there's a notable need for more advanced To-do list features. The existing functionalities are quite basic."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"EDIT: Found even more issues. It is not possible to create repeating tasks with subtasks. Subtasks do not stay nested with their main task when either the subtask or the main task is completed, or when sorting by date. Similarly, when a main task is completed, the subtasks should stay nested under the main one, but they don't. There is no way to duplicate a task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"app is too slow. I can only move a task from one list to another on desktop, I can't on mobile app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"not a handy tool compared to MS todo"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app!! it definitely helped me out when it came to managing daily life. Thank you."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like to using task with google calendar. But every task need a color section."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"4.4 Stars"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's great 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"You don't get notifications."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The STAR/PRIORITY way of looking at a task is horrible! When a subtask is starred on the starred list, it does not show the parent task. - or TASK LIST"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Does it's job."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Notifications either aren't sending to my phone or they're sending incredibly late, completely missing the whole point of the app! This never happened with Reminders in Google Calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I love how they integrate it with google calendar, but I do kinda wish it had more features in it like Eisenhower matrix, timer in doing a task, a graph for monitoring your performance. Google is broad and it would be better if you do add more features for productivity."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very useful but it is the only to do app that lacks such important feature like 'today tasks'. One star down for this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Moving house"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"didn't always notify. a number of times there were 0 notifications. seemed to record them nonetheless"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Does not show notifications from reminders even though all permissions are turned on. Since reminders has changed to this tasks it's nowhere near as good."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"definitely have to have it on my phone very useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Search functionality is missing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it would be nice to collaborate with other people."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"تطبيق جيد يساعدك على ترتيب المهام و لله الحمد"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Widget color doesn't change when you change the app theme, only adjustment you can make is resizing."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use Reminder app period."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"multi-viscus complicated. I have an issue that keeps repeating and I can't find it anywhere to adjust it in the tasks from current, week, month old or completed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I would love an option to repeat after x days completion, an option that microsoft todo, ticktick etc provide."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Integrates perfectly in my ""Google World""."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Finish"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I can't share or assign tasks on this like I can with microsoft todo. Unfortunately the functionality to access this from my Calendar and Gmail isn't worth it. If I'm wrong please let me know!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"You should have given a analyser so that consumers could analyse their frequency of their task completion It would help then..to check their productivity..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"yigb"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"a task of the week can't be a task of today if the day comes?!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's wonderful app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"why google task inclusively doesn't have dedicated homepage like other google product, such as keep, calendar, contact,"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Notification function is still not functioning"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very usefull thanks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"At least , make default for date input, like just today or another if i want, it little bit frustrating when i make it today but need more action for this"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great daily organizer"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The app's push notifications stopped popping up for some reason, it is on me to remember that I should have a task scheduled and to check the app. This makes the app less useful than a sticky note. A month after this feedback, it is the exact same thing. This app is essentially a brick on your mobile device."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"handy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I don't think I'd be employed without these tasks/reminders. I've never had any issues while using this app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It's a great app when it works. Often times reminders I set, either via the voice assistant or manually, don't pop up at their designated time. That's not a reminder"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"@Hoodini"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I do not need, or want, a separate app for tasks. Now, Tasks notifies me and Calendar notifies me. I want to get rid of the Tasks notification but I don't even have it installed. Just kill this stupid project, please."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great product but I liked it better when it was reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"What is going with this rubbish app? It literally doesn't remind me anything I ask, nothing comes up on screen, notifications are ON. I have deleted and redownload nothing. Google reminders never skipped a bit. @google please fix this garbage app 🙏"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's okay if you add tasks in the Calendar app, but if you want to make changes directly in the Tasks app, it's very unintuitive. Once you set the date, you can't change it. Same thing if you accidentally put something on the wrong list. If you have a repeating task, you can't edit just one of them or delete just one of them. All of this can be done through the Calendar app. It's just weird to me that you can't make the same edits directly in the Tasks app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"In my case, it's 'the' Perfect app for study goals. It really helps me keep track of all I have to do.....even shopping list and other miscellaneous tasks.....anything u want to remember to do, google's got ur back. I love Google. I always give preference to google apps over any other open source app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Like date and time feature"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"unintuatiive"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Doesnt ring properly"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Dentist appointment"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"notifications are not coming in time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It works but I liked it when I had the option to snooze a task for an hour and it would remind me again later."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app it helps me in Google knock some stuff out that needs to get done paid or bought or work that I need to complete."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"great app for reminders love that u can sync computer and other accounts"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"its a good app just add the option of inserting in an image or any external resource"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Sounds like this app has a level of security alert. What if it get hacked then causes a death following the task?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Continually not showing reminders and yes notifications are enabled. Some of us rely on apps like this to keep us on track when you need to get too granular to just use the calendar. I will be switching back to iPhone if this does not get fixed. This is a non-negotiable."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Ever since having to switch to Tasks for my reminders, it's been a problem. The app will randomly stop sending reminders. I use to rely heavily on the original Assistant reminders but the new Tasks app has been very unreliable."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"the app tasks is very helpful without it. i don't know what I would do. I would most likely forget everything I need to do every day."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I think Google is a good account but I find it hard to remember my passwords if I want to get into something to make it private"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Very frustrating to input tasks, especially via Google Assistant, barely hears half you say, puts in the wrong time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not receiving notifications. Tasks has been granted all permissions. After opening tasks to inquire, the days notifications will pop. Until then and after, I do not get notifications. This is extremely frustrating."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helping and convenience"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"so cute"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It works really well, easy to understand and use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome, seamless"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very helpful, helps me manage and organize"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"perfect"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Please add back ""remind me in x hours"" to the timed reminder notifications"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"You should be able to subgroup repeating tasks to keep it more organized. As well as multi-delete them"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I have a task but some times don't work, for me it's complicated to use it ."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"reminders, notifications do not work"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"reminder keeps repeating every year"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"亗ᎮᴀɢᴀᏞ ᭄M10࿐"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A great way to remember tasks for each day."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's great."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like the how easy it is."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Keep is better. Repeating tasks do not appear on the calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Would give 0 stars if possible. Had no choice but to switch from reminders to tasks, I'm now missing all notifications, alarms are not going off, it will not read back lists to me, some lists have either moved or been deleted and isn't adding items unless done manually. No longer recognises my voice."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good and simple to use. Would be better if I can set multiple alarms before the tasks. I use it for appointments. Getting an alert at the beginning of the day and an hour before then ten minutes before will suit the way I juggle my time. otherwise much better than the previous system"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great for grocery lists!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I'm tired of all the review surveys. I'm just sick of them"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I hope I can get it opened back up"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"need notification option"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I travel a lot for work and used to be able to sync my emails to my calendar without having to enter any information. It just carried over. Now I have to add them to a task in a separate app and then sync that? And it doesn't even autofill the date and time from the specific email anymore either. This is a massive step backwards. Trying to be efficient and google keepa making things more difficult. Awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I need to remember to utilize this more often, I am a list oriented person and almost can't function without doing it daily to stay on track. I used to only use the Samsung notes app on my galaxy s20 and always wished I was able to use it exactly how this app works. it's always helped me so much more using an actual notebook and doing the physical writing, but I hate wasting paper and my rocket notebook gets messed up too easily. the stylus with my s23 ultra is definitely a bonus experience!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Unable to sort tasks as I want."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"What's frustrating is that when I set a task, there is only a small, quick pop-up reminder that appears from the notification bar. Whereas if I set an event in Google Calendar or even a Samsung reminder, it appears on all my Android devices as an alarm type reminder. All settings have been checked. What's the point of a reminder if I have to remind myself to check for it? Please adjust this if possible."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"A little basic, but still very good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"5 bintang"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"it is good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome app!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"ok, could be easier to manage sub tasks etc but ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"its great🔥"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good for indyviduals with short memory"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome way to stay on top of things."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I used this app to keep track of schoolwork, not realizing that the ""reminder notifications"" are sent out *at* whatever time you set a task to be due at instead of before (you know, like a reminder). In this case, I missed an electronic quiz because the ""reminder"" was sent out as the quiz was due. An abysmal lack of forward thinking. Use something else."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Please add tags. and the ability to schedule subtask time in the CREATION phase itself (Now you need to create the subtask then to get out of the task to schedule it)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"App is great, easy listing of tasks, and time and date Downside is the repeat is only available for the same date, instead of 1st Sunday or so (e.g. January 6 task will happen every January 6 instead of first Saturday of each year)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Requirements: -Adding advanced sorting of tasks -Search capability -Create a color scheme for better categorization"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"fantastic app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy reminders. Absolutely recommend, especially for on the go moms."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Calendar reminders worked, but google killed it off for this junk. No integration with google assistant. Why do you continue to hurt your consumer base google?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great method to keep me up-to-date with my tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Helps Me with organizing my errands, etc"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Needs separate lists and a dedicated full web app for the desktop to make it more efficient."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"First-time user, it looks promising"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I can't change list orders, so I preefer use keep notes"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app empower tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"useful application with good UI/UX"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Instead of showing ""x tasks pending"" in calendar widget, just show the actual task. Like how reminders were shown."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Unable to search for upcoming tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's Neat and Useful and very easy to use and make notes , especially when you want certain things popped up without a timer or even daily especially for reminders on taking vitamins daily,eating daily, and doing different things daily. it's a very useful app to have and a must download for people who wants to keep track of things throughout their day."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Great potential for this app to be good, but like many things Google, potential is often ignored and kicked into the corner until Apple does it better and Google is embarrassingly trying to catch up with a snide advertising campaign that actually sways public image away from them"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I am a little old school so Iuse this app daily to keep my priorities straight."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Starred tasks needs to carry over from day to day. Example: I star all of the important things on multiple lists, so I can see them on one big list (the starred list). But repeating tasks do not carry their star over to the next time the task appears. So my weekly reminder to buy crickets for my lizard doesn't appear in my ""important"" list, only my shopping list that I rarely view, unless I remember to re-star it manually each week."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Like this app, very useful 😏"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"it doesn't give notification reminders is all"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It would be great if you make it where you can rearrange the actual list, not just the items in the list. If you do that It would be the perfect list app. Everyone that agrees,please rate this app. Thank you!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I am happy to be here"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I'm a boss Google user and love me tasks LTG xxx"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Hackers using this app to stalk me, track, harass. don't feel safe and can't get help by emailing."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The app is great but why is a ""voice tasks"" feature not available. I also can't specify repeating a task many times at the same day, with time specified of course."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Really helps me keep tabs on a lot of things"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Well come"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The very fact that you cannot sync the tasks from this app with Google Calendar makes this app useless. The app itself is just a to-do list with folders.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy way to make sure I don't forget things to do"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Worst app please don't waste your time It will never remind your tasks...."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"sometimes reminders don't go off, they also don't show up on Google calender. Not the best update tbh!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it works for keeping track of on going tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"What can I say, my notifications are just not working straight up & Google has no concept of customer service. We're screwed due to over-reliance. This is why monopolies are bad."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The best and the simplest for pretty much everything."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's good!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"just a good way to remind myself and create a to-do list on short notice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Didn't show me reminder for the task I set"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"the set task don't always pop up with notifications on the correct time and dates"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Notifications doesn't work all of a sudden. They are on. Need to find something new."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"when it goes off there is no announcement as alexa does."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Notifications work randomly. Some days i get nothing, and have to open the app to reset it and get all the notifications at once that are past due and i missed important things because of it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Bad design"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"the best"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Why do you even have this app when Google Keep does all this does plus more. It's high time Google does something to its ecosystem. Any reminders and tasks I add goes to Tasks and Google Keep is manual work. I want to add stuff by voice to Google Keep. Things are all over the place. Fix it! Have one app for both these things. Saves your time, our time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love the app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This help me do much on getting ready for a big trip and I lived to reminders on dates for things that had to be done ."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please allow to adjust duration for tasks on Google calendar. Right now it's defaulted to 30mins."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"man,management"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"SAMSUNG REMINDERS better: sort, create checklists inside 1 reminder & click it to mark done/put line thru (so can remind to go to Walmart then add a list underneath it, no need to go elsewhere for list); add unlimited photos or documents to a reminder (for appts). TASKS doesn't let u tell how many times to repeat, it does it indefinitely so must go in to turn it off (or remember which just adds more to do)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Just installed this app. I asked it to set a task using the assistant, for Saturday, which is two days hence. It repeats what I have said correctly and then when the task is created it says 'task created for tomorrow at...' etc . Tomorrow being Friday. Tried a few times, same result. My date and timezone is correct on my phone. I think you would agree this renders the app as useful as a chocolate teapot!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please fix Inonsistent notifications! What's the point of a reminder if it doesn't always remind you."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Fantastic!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"clean and simple"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I like the concept of having tasks in one place. I love the tasks widget in Chrome. I hate the fact that I cannot find in this app how to view my list of recurring tasks, so that I can update them. I have to go track them down in the calendar app for example. It's a very stupid way to have to do that."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminders literally work better if you don't have this app installed. Regardless of notification settings being turned on, this app never sends me notifications for my reminders. As soon as I uninstalled it, reminders starting working again perfectly."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I stand with GOOGLE"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Simple interface to create tasks. The must be a way to rearrange ""lists"" the way you want it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ok i am right ."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I was using this app frequently for the past few years but after October 1 when the data was moved from Reminder to Tasks, I am not able to login or sync to my Google account through app. Dear Google, please help!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"notifications don't work"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Need persistent / sticky notification for task reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Notifications do not show up with all settings turned on."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Tasks comes in handy. I have terrible memory so I make sure to put everything important in Tasks. It keeps me on track and I can't think of any complaints with it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So useful. Have to go to web calender to add tasks to the phone calender. Easy to use, no confusing bits."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No notifications for scheduled tasks making the whole app basically pointless"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Very limited"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Review update on November 8th 2023.: One of my most regularly used apps, Google Calendar integration is fantastic. It's still desperately needs a search function to be given that fifth star. I love to use emoticons to help differentiate tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"had some problems with actually entering a task. sometimes I had to do it twice."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Whatsapp ni ban rhi"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Clean interface, but the inability to share tasks with other users is a real letdown. Microsoft To-Do app has much tighter integration in this regard."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very very nice 👌"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"idk why it took me so long to start using this. it's 10 stars"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I need reminders back. This app isn't good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Hello Google team. The tasks(Previously Reminders) no longer sends notifications since one of your latest updates. Please include notification option to tasks as it is with Events when using calendar. Please also include an option for start and Finish time with tasks. Thank you"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this is Great!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Decided to transition from Microsoft To Do to get the most out of Google Assistant. Two features I miss are the ability to assign a task directly within the app (navigating to Spaces in the chat app is cumbersome and unintuitive), and to move them between lists. Otherwise this is a solid alternative and I'm hopeful to see it grow and reach feature parity soon!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Since the compulsory upgrade from reminders, Tasks is underwhelming. It regularly fails to alert me for reminders, which goes against the whole point of this app. Please sort this out. EDIT: Some days this app just does not work. If there was an option to give it zero stars, I would. It's so bad I'll be replacing it with a different app. EDIT: This app gets worse and worse. Probably the worst app I've ever used. It's now started *deleting* tasks that I've scheduled. Very frustrating."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very easy and clean, got everything you need and not more (which is nice because the app is not cluttered like many others). I would really like to have the feature to share and edit lists with others, though."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Greate"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app improved my life"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Should be able to share with another user."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love all Google stuff, works beautifully"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"creditor"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love the app and the ability to sync with my Google TVs, google home displays. Just need to add Wear OS support or at least in my case, Galaxy Watch support. I can run most Google apps, this would be a nice addition."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love it! gonna think of some features or could use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Doesn't has upload file option in App! Also list is non sharable! No option to share list with teammates!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"There's no way to get a notification for the task. You can't even do this in Google Calendar. Well, it's in the Google Calendar but it doesn't work. So I'll have to stick with Bixby."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great tool."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"so far so good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Этому приложению нельзя доверять. Уже много раз не напомнило"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great App! Works Like a charm..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"handy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"In my opinion, there should be a vibration, flash, or chime mode. Something that brings your Task or reminders to your awareness. Hope that I'm making sense."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very great reminder app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love Google, I'm speechless in the way Google keeps me organized"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"integrated with calendar but very limited functions."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It does what you need it to but it's a bit too rigid and difficult to navigate the top bar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Recurring completed task does not show up in task view until the day it is due. Very unproductive design. The next instance of it should automatically be visible in task view after the completion of the previous one; or at least one week prior to it's expected due date. Tasks has a long way to go to become a proper Todo list app if it can't even treat recurring tasks appropriately."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Efficient way to track your to do list and feel good about it each time you tick a task that's complete"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"During daylight saving all my tasks were late by one hour. I reset all my tasks to the time I want, but the tasks are still coming in 1 hour late."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Or I don't know what I meant"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Please help me with my password Gmail account"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This ""tasks"" sucks!! It dosen't notify me at the time I tell it,and I can't find the list easily, also if the time passes for that ""task"" it vanishes......the perfectly working *REMINDERS* THAT GOT TAKEN for ""tasks"" BOOOOO 👎👎REWIND IT BACK TO REMINERS!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Just started using it. you guys are thirsty. Add a timer for each task so if you're the type of person who wants to alot a certain time to a task, there can be a stopping point. No app ever takes my suggestions though so... decent app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Thank God, they finally updated it to where you can hide completed tasks!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Some problem arise in syncronisation.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"its great and works well"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Just Default Theme..... Please Give Theme's. Also Custom design Theme."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Can add reccurring reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Overall Good ...But Please Add Notifications Service so that all devices connected with same Google Account get notification on same moment."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"If you want to make reoccurring tasks you cannot add sub tasks . This is unfortunate if you plan to make daily checklists."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"please add a feature to this app with which we can categorise the tasks into different lists based on the nature of the work while adding tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Need to add place alerts like Microsoft Tasks. If this feature could be added then this would become my default task manager. Until Google is able to provide this update though, I will continue with Microsoft tasks. Being able to be alerted on a particular task when you arrive or depart a specific location is so advanced and useful!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It would be nice if you could swap the place of the bigger groups in the block at the top. Other than that I love the app. It's connected with your Google agenda, you can prioritize and easily swap places of the tasks in the list and it keeps everything you have completed which I find very motivational!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's useful to us and remember that have my schedule so it was good to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's an electronic secretary in the palm of your hand"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It would be great if we could rearrange Task List order."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"needs some work, most tasks pass me be silently. I think it should pop-up boldly on the screen or probably a specific alarm"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works great for me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"does whats needed 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Perfect so far, I hope I get some cash for bills this month."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's just the most basic app. It barely does what it's supposed to. It misses a lot of key features like a cohesive way to track your progress or track your habits. I guess it is made for tasks, but Google can really improve this app to be more about productivity in general. It would also be nice if it integrated with keeps (keeps doesn't integrate with anything really) and also why can't you see subtasks in the widget. Very basic app, not recommended."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Just fit my needs."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Actually reduces functionality of reminders. There is no more ""remind me in 1 hour"" option."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No windows/desktop app for this feature. Need to rely on gmail webapp or android phone which is inconvenient"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I put a time in for a scheduled task it came up 2 hours late comes up 5 minutes late cuz of 10 minutes late something's wrong"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it does what I want, and nothing more"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"maybe google tasks needs some edit even be able to do many things, but he's not bad, he's my fav app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A*"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"App block words with ***, how to delete this blockages."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"reminder is not working"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I like it but it's missing lots of useful feature like recognizing date and time when typing a task and the ability to batch add tasks (like in todoist when I finish typing a task and hit enter the box stays with the cursor inside so that I can easily add the next task)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"a good task app, would be better if it supported collaboration"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Missing tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Minimal and Effective! Helps me alot"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"هاااااااايل"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"no hour back or forward for u all to try it again and again. who knows the hours. not the say to change it. I feel like you guys and things tells me what to do with my mind of the clock. get a license to tell the time. bye"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is reliable app. Thanks 🙏"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Ever since tasks was put in place I do not get my reminders. have missed meetings and forgotten to take my pills because of this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"how do i request the link in my tasks, to show its page i have saved?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"👍👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Just bad. It's turned into some sort of Google Keep. They've moved all reminders to tasks but now they don't show notifications nor pop ups and it's just lackluster."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Freaking awesome 👍🏼 thank you...now I'm set"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"so far it's been extremely helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Works ok. Integration with Gmail and calendar is decent. Needs to have a search function."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"ᴇᴀsʏᴀɴᴅᴘʟᴇᴀsɪɴɢᴛᴏᴏ"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The notifications are very unreliable. Sometimes they are on time as expected, sometimes they are a random number of minutes late, and sometimes they never appear at all. Totally defeats the purpose of a ""reminder"" or ""to-do"" app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love all their help"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good tool to track task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and I love the integration with Google Calendar. I love having all of my Tasks in one place and that I can access it in Google Calendar easily."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Broke my Google assistant reminders! Always reminds next day regardless of which date I tell it to remind on!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It looks neat and couldve been done well, but it has too many flaws for me to keep it. My most frustrating one being that it doesnt keep your repeating tasks in the order you set them, so when the next day comes theyre all jumbled and I end up having to reorder them each time. The reminders arent consistent either, more often or not they just dont remind you entirely. Ive had better luck with indie developer task apps, so uh... Yeah Im sticking with those from now on. Sorry, Google."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very good app helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's a very nice app it reminds me about what I have to do and at the right time 🤩🤩"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Want more features"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The app still has major gaps: 1. No day in review look 2. Does not work well across OS platforms 3. No search function... the list goes on and on."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Doesn't work all the time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app lication is very useful and beautiful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This helps me keep track of things when my plate is full and it helps reminds me so I don't get overwhelmed..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Task need to be activated including information due to the house finish California Palm 832 Palms boulevard Venice 90219 This was a house"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It syncs my phones reminders to my Google home speaker, and my speaker's reminders to my phone, making remembering stuff way easier."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Didn't work well 😔"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"like"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Block temu"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"please add agregated view on tasks and ad some filtering"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A very good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"هذا البرنامج رائع و بشده"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good to keep track of things you need like groceries, bad at reminding you when you set the time to do stuff, the app sends notifications whenever it wants"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This is fine for one-off reminders (though as others have suggested, the option to colour-code would be helpful) However, it really falls down on repeating tasks. Whenever I have set one up, all is well until the first occurrence has been completed. From then on, although the subsequent ones appear in my Calendar, they do NOT appear in the Tasks app, so I cannot see a complete list of all upcoming tasks. I have submitted this as feedback a couple of times, but there has been no response ☹️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good Application 👍🏼"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Why would you take reminders away? Tasks don't even notify you what you have for the day. Sometimes I go for days with a task pending because I never saw it. Make it so we get notifications about our tasks!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great 👍👍👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"They added a way to change the notification sounds so you know it's a Task reminder, which is awesome! Thanks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"No nonsense app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Should have more features, it's too basic"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"How do I delete a task there's no instructions there's no way to do it I guess I just uninstall the app and never use it again"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminders won't popup in the task bar, disappointed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This was my REMINDERS app that was hi-jacked by this trash that literally does a TERRIBLE job at reminding me of anything! At least improve the notifications!! I keep missing reminders! Using Google Pixel 8pro, and the notifications from this app are SO easy to miss. Make these banners more than 1 line, or give us the option to bump them to the top of the list of notifications. Improve this bc it's becoming a huge nuisance and really putting a damper on my pixel experience."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"another stellar product"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"This app is barebones! Microsoft's ToDo is miles ahead."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I don't understand what happens everytime with notification. It's often delivered way much later than the actual time of reminder no matter if battery saver is on or off."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good tool. The only thing I don't like is they changed what happens when you mark a task completed. On the calendar it used to pu the show the task completed on the day it was completed, but now it shows it completed on the day it was originally dated to be completed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I've tried a lot of these apps, but this is still the definitive, free to-do app. It integrates very well with Assistant, combined with any generative AI, helps even the most disorganized get back on track."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I greatly enjoy Google Tasks. However, wouldn't it be even better if pictures could be attached directly to tasks?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"والله واحد من اكثر التطبيقات الاستفد منا في الحامعة"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"the emails or contact information for some of my tasks were not saved or if saved any information,it became scattered and no sense in the English language"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"ease my daily life"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"lo necesario"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Forced to convert from Reminders but it does notify you of anything."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Quite mediocre. The widget is where it is lacking. While I admire how it syncs up with the calender, the widget offers little usage. Enough to warrant using the standard Samsung reminders. Room for improvement: please allow a view to show all task menus that are colour coded and sortable. Also, the widget is hidious. Please implement a setting to add transparency. I would like to see my background and not a giant navy blue box. Thank you."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great tool to help keep track of all the things I have to do. Repeated and one-offs."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Please add a snooze button for reminders, if I don't have time to do a task in the moment then it should be easy to snooze the reminder for later so I don't forget about it. Please enable an ""all tasks"" view rather than forcing queues to always be separate. I basically want the queues to be ""categories"" but I need to see across all of them sometimes. Add an ""upcoming"" task view that lets you see all tasks scheduled for the next couple days. Add task prioritization system."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please add seach functionality to this app so that I can find a perticular tast between a lot of task easily otherwise the app is great, I will change my rating when you add search bar to the app Hope you will listen."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"why did you change reminders to task. it doesn't make any sense"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"There is no am or pm feature"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works well integrates nice between samsung phone and windows pc"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No reminders or notifications or sound at all, it's a garbage! Going to look for others now"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"doesn't actually remind you/notify you of a task, just lists it on the day. reminder function in calendar was so much better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Where is the history in this app?!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good enough"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very nice app. Here i can make scheduled weekly monthly and repetitive task along with great option by clicking task completed. Also i already logged the grocery items, which need to be enhanced by forwarding each item with purchased amount and quantity which make me a expected bill before going to counter. Once value entered be saved which will be helpfull in future purchasing of total value."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This makes things SO much easier. I love how it connects to your calendar. Definitely a very useful tool to have!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It is missing a place where I can see all the tasks from all the different lists. Also it is missing more options for sorting...too limited"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"tasks sucks. doesn't even remind you when you set a reminder."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good app that keeps track of task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"When complet sub task they turn separate task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"There's no way to see today's pending tasks in the app. Add a widget or a smart list that can show today's tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's amazing where I am ADHD it's very hard for me to keep focused this helps so much because it links to my calendar where I can keep track of my agenda and Google home reminds me through my routines each night and mornings keeping me on track"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very essential ""Search"" feature missing. Everything else is great!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"New York"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Wow ! Like I'm just getting started with everyone of my gadgets are google tech product."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it doesn't integrate seamless with other Google apps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"regress over time. we could set alarms and reminders they all seem do have diseapear. confusing. useless..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"When you do a desktop version (pc, mac)?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple, self-explanatory and easy to use -- never lets me down. Love the integration with Gmail in particular! RECOMMENDED!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Can we please, please, please have this added to the apps on the pixel watch? I can't add it to the complications slot of my watch face because it's not included in the main apps menus, only the play store. 😩 So many apps are like this. It's so frustrating. Not everyone uses a smart watch for fitness. I need mine for life admin. Thank you."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"~¥Computer Built Vichaels¥~."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Only used, and didn't need"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google Task is handy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Improvement Required for: 1. We can't set reminding alarm for a perticular task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Sad that it's not able to set alarm time in desktop app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"fun"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Horrible experience since Google forced everyone to use this app. It never notifies me unless the open is constantly open. This was far better when it was integrated in Calendars."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"it doesn't send notifications to my phone. I have missed several appointments because of this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Lee Lambert Warren Sr. God is first..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"like this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love it. easy to use and synced with calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice .. its keeping my life organized in a simple way .. app friendly to use and well sync with other google apps"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good useful app but a little crashing. Haha!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"How to uncomplete all completed tasks in a list? You can't!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very helpful to keep your tasks and events organised."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great tool for managing my CEO duties 😁"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I just started using and I'll let you know after a month or so"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"completed tasks just are gone forever"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Completely trash"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"hello everyone, Just for your information Be sure to delete all the past tasks to avoid any troubles in the near future. Thank you so much for reading this infos and good luck!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice way to maintain a to do list. A plus that it syncs with my Google calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great service"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"really simple to use ! Enough for me to get some discipline :)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I'm trying to get used to the Google Tasks app, but finding it difficult. It would be so much more helpful if there was a sort by name option and or a search function."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminders don't fire since the migration from simple calendar reminders, defeats the whole purpose of the app. Not an upgrade of any sort."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good apps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"app are simple and good but kindly add some more features or themes to make it superb. 😊"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Repeating tasks, please."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Kpmgeminitraders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I didn't know that"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good basic tasks app but heavily lacking in advanced features."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like it just taking a while to get used to"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy and minimal"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Perfect for someone with ADHD like me to keep track and remind"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I'll keep it short: it doesn't work. At all. For anyone. No notifications of tasks which is kind of the whole point"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent but Not paid membership.. reason is zero value of my self"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Evening, truly grateful for the support, that i am receiving always... . thanks ❕ for your time and enjoy your Happy Halloween Day 👻 to everyone"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminders turned into Tasks, but there's no reminders that come up telling you the task needs to be done. For example, I had a Reminder set to take the trash out each week and once Reminders turned into Tasks, I was not reminded to take the trash out. It's been incredibly annoying not being reminded of all the Reminders I had set and I'll probably stop using the Tasks app all together for this reason."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"So much potential. It covers some important basis but is still in a 'most viable product"" stage due to a lack of features. For instance, users should be able to drag tasks from one list to another."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The notification cannot be sent sometimes The program must be checked and three notifications should appear"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Handy app to have tied to Google account. Easy to pick up and use. One thing I would really like to have is number of uncompleted tasks next to each task list. E.g. for a task list called ""Home"" with 4 remaining tasks, to have it like Home(4) at the top. And have it as a toggle in the app's settings, like ""Show remaining tasks in lists: On/Off"". Hope the devs consider this. ^^"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It does the most basic thing, that is setup a task and mark it as completed, no categories nor subcategories and no priorities; it works though. It's possible to schedule tasks and make them repetitive. The on-screen widget is useful but not too functional."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"there is not much options available to categories so bifurcate different tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Reminders should allow one to specify the time zone."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Arbitrary just stops working after a few weeks. Disappointing!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"How come it doesn't have reminders?, it's really bizarre that tasks don't have reminders ahead of the task to make sure it's completed. Any explanation?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy yo use and wonderful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Kindly add the feature that we can share the task with our family member with their google account."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Can't snooze/postpone from the notification - this is just deal breaker for task management app. No option to configure notifications to repeat until you compete the task, if you accidentally swipe notification it will just get lost."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful on the phone"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So far... It's working really nicely."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Absolutely garbage, since reminders were moved from calendar to tasks I've missed loads of things, because this horrible app has half the functionality and is totally unintuitive. But mainly because I never seem to get reminded of tasks due, on my phone. Waste of time. Starting to move away from Google as their products get worse and worse"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The option of changing the visual order of the tasks in the list would help."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The basic functionality would be OK for me. My main complaint though is that the app opens with PAST tasks. To find TODAY I have to scroll down the list. Very annoying!! Every calendar has a button to jump to today... Maybe there is one and I missed it?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like it so far 💕👩🏾‍💼🫶🏾👩🏾‍🤝‍👨🏼"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Great but there's more tweaks to make this much better (see Wunderlist pre Microsoft takeover)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Sounds good for me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I don't think this should have replaced reminders. The experience is far worse"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"not sure"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"RAP"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very simple and useful task application"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I miss the old version. this one makes me think I've completed tasks when I haven't"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not working like the previous Google assistant task and automatically if the battery saving is activated and the app closes and does not give notification on time such a waste of time Google tasks."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't send me notifications"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's helps me manage by tasks better by starring the important tasks .It increased my productivity."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Absolutely no reason for this to be a separate app, and now it doesn't even send notifications for reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Need more feature like staying on notification untill its mark done, nees option like auto timings by typing in task like other app recognize, if these 2 option is there then this app will the number 1 in the world"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Need search function! Also, a quick means to move a task to the top spot."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Absolutely terrible"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple and easy to use!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"add edit option for listed itom"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Tried reinstalling, double checked all notification settings, but my devices including my phone aren't getting reminders. If this takes the place of Google calendar reminders, where's the missing functionality? Thanks for making it harder to remember if I took my meds, Google! 😛"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Colour coding is what is missing in this app. I love the fact that it is easy to use and convenient. If there was a way to colour code the task categories or as per the priority, it would be really helpful. With so many people requesting it, can't it be something to look at for future updates?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I need the option to mark a task as, “Started” or “50% complete!” Sharing / Assigning Tasks to others would also be a great addition to this app? I want it to be as good as Microsoft Teams? After all, it has the potential. 🤔"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"doesn't always alert. makes it pointless"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"doesn't sync with phone reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Widget is finally there but could be improved. Now it just need to include tags - and maybe statuses and it's perfect."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I have added a daily reminder using Google voice assistant and after some days I deleted it using voice assistant. It was deleted and my task list are empty. But still I'm getting the reminder daily. I checked fully there is no tasks in the list. I don't know how to stop this. My only option is disable the notification permission for Google notifications. Can you help me to resolve this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Amazing app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"... looking forward for a excellent experience. The reason I picked four or five stars, it's my decision. ....... we'll see if that's time, and is well spent."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Please improve upon the widgets and make the time of the task visible even when widgets are of small size. I have been waiting for an update for a long time fixing the issue. Yet there is no response. Is this app really made and maintened by Google? Very bad customer service."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very nice 👍👍 APP"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Is the development team an intern in a basement? It seems simple but has some very strange UI choices that are not standard or present in any another Google app. For me a todo / planner app that doesn't allow copy & paste or moving tasks between outlines is DOA"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Worse than reminders in every way."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"You only get notifications of your tasks when you are connected to the internet even if the tasks were created and saved locally on the phone 👎 What's the point of this app then? I can get the same effect in the browser"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Tasks is horrible and ineffective. Bring back calendar reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It does the essentials. The widget works on my phone. No glitches so far. Unfortunately, There's an issue where you cannot create a recurring task with subtasks. When you add a subtask, the option to add recurrence disappears. Pretty much every other tasks app out there has way more customization features. I'd like to see the subtask / recurring tasks issue fixed, and the ability to color code all of your tasks added. This app needs to catch-up to the others!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I have a Google pixel 7. It is ""made by Google"", touting the benefits of advanced AI and the Google assistant in your pocket. It is rather strange that you cannot use Google assistant on a Google Pixel 7 to add items to Google Tasks. A similar issue exists with Google Keep, another note taking app by Google. This issue has persisted since I bought my Pixel in November 2022. Google really missing the mark in recent years... Guess it's time to switch to Siri. Do not believe the fake Google reviews"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"missing some core features like shared tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love the app and tasks in general. only wish there was also a Webapplication online, like notes has, or organise my tasks more easy."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I liked Google Assistant for reminders better. Tasks doesn't always notify for reminders, and, if it does, it doesn't have a snooze function."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"barely works. Bad Google, Bad!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Improve features and functionality as an extremely helpful appreciated much..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"thanks 😊 Google"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"add an alarm option for task time,now its only show notification when screen is on if phone is locked not showing task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"it should have an alert on the task to let you know that a task is being dumb I needs to be done"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Life changing. No exaggeration. The reminders pop up in my notification bar instead of just around the house on my nest and speakers."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent application. I love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Notifications for reminds are now a toss up on whether they actually show up."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"this app is almost perfect, you just missing ONE THING, pls add a deadline feature of each task, not just the date where the task occurs, also add remidners, not notification when the time is on it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it is good as a very simple tool with great function and accesibility accross devices. i would like to see a little more functionallity and the ability to share tasks or lists with others."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"This app has one of the worst user interfaces I've ever seen in a task manager. The weird idea of having a horizontal list of your task lists means you can't comfortably have very many lists. It's fine if you have very basic ToDo lost needs but you couldn't reasonably do something like GTD with this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Why do you have to make another app and make things complicated?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"For me, this is a great way to keep way to keep up with all my stuff!! Plus, it's all on my phone so I don't have to carry around 1,000 scraps of paper!!!☺️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's not much to it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"a good app. for things to do"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"great, except there is no way to mass delete tasks. very frustrating."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I can't add subtasks to a recurrent task. I want to use it to remind me stuff every other day."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"why can't I remove tasks set to repeat in the app?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The organization of the lists are very well done."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I think it would be nice if I can turn on multiple notifications for a single task. I want the app to notify me like 1 or 2 days or hours before my actual task. Like how we can do for events."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Only makes calendar spam"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"This is less user friendly than Google reminders. It often doesn't send notifications and I miss reminders I've set. Very frustrating."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I wanted something like notes in my 📆, but this does the trick. I rarely give five stars, but considered doing so here. Not everything is a task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"works great once you've synced everything together"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"With latest update the features have improved. I would like to request Google regarding adding a pomodoro timer. Or seperately design a pomodoro clock that can fetch from the task that is tobe executed. So that one can do deep work without distraction and later one can find the amount of time spent on each work if required. It would be helpful for better planning."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app to keep me organised"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It is showing everything good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"You can tell the devs were just knocking out a contract rather than enthusiastically building an app they'd love. It's...eh. Google used to be so invasive a decade ago. Now it just feels like another soulless cash farmer scraping the margins"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The PC version has some limits for example you can't set an exact time for a task, for functions like that you have to have a phone in your hand, which can be a pain in the butt, because sometimes you just don't want to pick up your phone while working"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The widget just suddenly stopped showing my tasks. The whole point of moving Gmail to a different home screen, even though I've had it on the first screen for years, was because my task list is more important now, because I'm so irresponsible, and I wasn't getting stuff done. Now Google has failed me. Again."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple program and I use it every day"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Google added a bunch of website bookmarks to my tasks list making the app unusable."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helps me keep up on what I need to accomplish. so easy to add something. homescreen widget is awesome as well"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"App does not reliably send notifications. I don't know if it's that my Pixel keeps killing the app for battery saving or what, but I never get the critical notifications I need from this app ever since Google split off tasks from the calendar. This is SUPER BAD since I used calendar to give me reminders about medication. The only way I can get the app to send a notification is to manually open it, then all of today's notifications suddenly pop up at once."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Can't share lists with others. Keep was fine."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Ever since Google Assistant changed over to Google Tasks, it completely sucks now! Whenever you want to set a reminder or task, it asks you what the title is. When you try to actually tell it what the title is, it says, ""Sorry, I didn't get the title. What is the title?"" I wish Google Assistant would go back to being Google Assistant completely separate from Google Tasks! As a matter of fact, as soon as all of my tasks are completed, I am getting rid of the app!!!"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good like"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Overall a terrible transition from Google Assistant reminders. There is no way to quickly set it to remind you again at a specific time interval like reminders, and it's just like a one-time thing. Also the Google nag that keeps saying in order to get alerts for tasks you must turn this on or turn this off or whatever. No matter what I do I still keep getting that nag and absolutely ridiculous. Google, please fix this. Make it more like reminders or we can set a snooze as before. Thank you."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please add more granular frequency eg minutes and what not, similar to Samsung's. Sometimes we need the naggy kinda reminders for urgent items..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple, but gets the job done. Wishing it would integrate even more with Google Assistant"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"tasks helps me remember, AND complete each step needed, to get things done"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Amazing, especially since they integrated it with Google Assistant. I can add tasks to an app easily with my voice and it syncs to my Google Calendar. The only thing missing is a google task watch app. I am using Todoist right now since it has an app for every platform - I can do tasks and complete them from my wrist. If there was a google task app on your watch, you could create reminders with your voice from Google nest speaker, Wear Os Watch or Android and it would appear on your watch."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Worthless. I am never notified. All Battery optimisation settings are disabled and Notifications are enabled but this app never works."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"needs to be able to: 1) cross tasks rather than disappear 2) search tasks 3) add photos 4) have subtaks better integrated with main task. i can go to subtask from main task but not the other way around 5) have labels like Keep rather than list system so that a task can have multiple labels Just make it a proper app like the others on the playstore. ----- People are using this insufficient app just because it is natively integrated with google calendar."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The Tasks App acts like an actual personal assistant!👌🏾"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Not as intuitive as Reminders / Calendar. The tasks disappear and are hard to find. Also, Tasks does not remind after the moment for a task has passed. Also, some my most important old reminders are gone now."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"as most of the basic functions you would expect. works fine for what I needed for. It's really good since it's free."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice app. precise and to the point"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"On the widget, when a recurring task is completed, the next occurrence doesn't show up on the task list until the day of the event. It should always show the next one. I want to be able to see them and not get surprised the day of the event."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple, quick, easy to use and EXTREMELY helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Could be nice to add location to trigger reminders in a location"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"App made useless but googles own app killing practices. Even low budget third party apps include warnings and instructions on how to avoid android from putting the app to sleep and missing notifications. For some reason Google isn't able to accomplish this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"When it comes to prioritizing my task and tracking what I need to do each day, Google Task helps out perfectly with the notification that keeps me in check."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Great app. There's still a lot to do about the UI/UX imo."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"🛰️📡🛰️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Oh great, you removed the reminders from the assistance that were completely fine and force me to use this trash. I'm still waiting for my notification on the task I scheduled for last week. Where is it? Does this app do anything or is it just made to not work?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Inconsistent reliability, which has had real world negative consequences for me. Uninstalled after months of frustration using the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is the best I have ever seen for my To-do list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"There is no easy way to ""snooze"" a reminder. Once a reminder is dismissed it is no longer shown in notifications."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it, seamless!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Find this very useful for daily reminders and repeating reminders as well. Have tried a few other apps but have found this to be the best. Even better now that Google assistant puts reminders into here too!"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Regularly doesn't notify me of reminders, and yes all notifications settings are set correct and the app is removed from battery saving functions. I've been using assistant for years to remind me to take meds but now it's so inconsistent at alerting me I can't rely on it for anything"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Wonderful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Meh"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Very poor and ineffective app by Google. The main function is for tasks/reminder but no notification comes for each tasks. Google Calendar reminder is very effective and no app can replace Google Calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Worst app. Literally doesn't remind you of anything. Why have it if you don't do the most fundamental function?"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"add every hour alert feature"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Thank you for taking care of this problem !"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Since the merge of reminders becoming tasks, I no longer get notifications for my tasks. I have to open the dam tasks app to see my tasks which defeats the purpose. Time to find another task app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"This is objectively worse than the old calendar reminder feature. The thing I miss the most of the ability to snooze a reminder for later"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I'm really bad at remembering almost anything, so this way of easily setting reminders is a godsend. Almost 300 and counting"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I think when this app works as intended, it's a great, albeit basic tool. Allot of people have had problems with not getting notifications though. My advice to everyone having this problem is to go into your settings and make sure that battery optimization is turned off for the tasks app. So far after using it for a couple days having done that, I've gotten all my notifications on time. Hope this helps!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Please introduce search function. It's a must for a productivity app. Thank you"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Just started using it around a week ago, it's not to bad pretty user friendly😉"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Worst reminder app ever. I am forced to use bixby to remind me as this app absolutly fails to do so. Bixby does a way better job."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I haven't had much to do with this app but I am hopeful it will be up to Google's high standards"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Missed an interview because this doesn't remind you about a task as it's coming up, only reminds you at the time. As a neurodiverse person with executive dysfunction problems I rely on apps like this and this one is a massive let down."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very good 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I am always trying to find a task or to do list app that is better than this one. I have found some that do more of what I want, but also don't do enough of what I need. I like this one because it's pretty simple in it's layout. That being said, one of my only complaints, is that I wish that it had a little bit of customization.. like some color coding, or prioritization tagging.. besides the star."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It would be good if when you typed canceled, the task would no longer be listed as needing to be done."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Notifications are so inconsistent. I don't get notified at all except I open the app. I have important reminders on this app guys. Update: I did the last update, notifications are still not working."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I have disabled battery saver restrictions for this app, allowed autostart, everything. Even so, the reminders show up hours after they were scheduled. This is garbage. Please revert things back like they were earlier."

This is a bug many have encountered, and if you rely on such things in order to complete matters in a timely fashion, it can really mess things up. Only solution was uninstalling this entirely, then turning the notification settings off then on again in Google Calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's a decent UI experience. I wished it was interconnected with Keep tho."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"False claim: ""View, edit, and manage tasks on the go, from any device"" The Oppo Smart Watch 46mm cannot view Google Tasks. The ""Reminders"" app has not been updated to ""Tasks"" and now does not load at all, preventing me from viewing or setting reminders on my smart watch whatsoever. Continued ""Reminders"" support for devices made by manufacturers (Oppo) who have yet to update a perfectly capable device to Wear OS 3.0 would have been appreciated."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good App for time management"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"is be so lost with out it 😲"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The notifications don't work so they don't get done at the time I need. What's the point?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"When it actually gives a notification for a task, that notification only stays on screen for a few seconds and then disappears, which is completely useless and doesn't come close to the same functionality as the reminders you could make in the calendar app, before you decided to remove that feature for some reason. Also has the same problem as other reminder apps; not giving notifications at all unless I opened the app myself recently. And yes, I have disabled battery saving ""optimisation""."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Migrated reminders came in with crazy dates, i.e. 6 years ago. Perhaps when they were created, but past due reminders are today without a time... or at least they were pre-migration. Task list is ridiculous. Unscheduled tasks are way at the bottom requiring a ridiculous amount of scrolling to even see. There's past due, today, tomorrow, this week, this month, future and unscheduled. These should be collapsible sections. Unscheduled need to be schedulable without jumping through hoops."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No notifications on reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"There was some sort of synchronization problem a while ago, my main account has duplicate lists, and won't send reminders or notifications, rendering the whole thing completely useless :("

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"sure helps me keep track & keeps me on track"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very good app for listing things, fantastic look, it can be added as Google Calendar support and you can add time frame also with regular alerts from it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Leave it to Google to replace Reminders, which had worked flawlessly every month for years, with this new Tasks. First month in, and Tasks just never sent me the first 'Task' notification to pay a bill, so now I have a late fee. This notification app can't do its only job, send me a notification when I scheduled, and it shouldn't disappear until I interact with it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It would be great if it could be used on its own, but the forced integration with other Google apps and devices has ruined it. I don't want my tasks to automatically be put as reminders on my Google home devices. But the only way to turn that off, is to turn off all personalised responses 🤦It used to be enough to untick ""Tasks"" in the calendar, but not anymore."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Don't use it..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's minimalistic and easy-to-use app, I like it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good app, especially if used together with Google calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"This app has very limited functionality and features and isn't very optimized to work with other Google service ( workspace ) ( isnt very interested ) and doesn't have a proper web address and a lot more.... But the app has decent UI. Please add more features and functionality like Microsoft to od ( my best pic )"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"There's not obvious reason why I me this app to recieve notifications for tasks that I create in Google calendar. Honestly please add this functionally back to Google calendar so I don't need another Google app installed for no reason."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"My productivity goes thru the roof every time I start using this application. Small, unintrusive, well designed. It can be accessed thru the Android App or thru the Web version. Plus, no need to sign in again as I'm always signed into Gmail and it uses the same google credentials and cookies."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Tasks is a complete waste of time. The notifications are absent or delayed to a point of uselessness. Such a bad experience overall from this app. Avoid."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"calendar tasks would keep the reminder up until you marked it complete, with Tasks the notification on my phone seems to disappear after a few hours."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love it ❣️😍 it's great with keeping you updated on the main thing that you have to do with also reminding you about the most important things to do with notifying you ahead of time like 2 days ahead!!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app, needs a watch apl"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This thing doesn't work I was testing it because I wasn't getting alerts about anything and all I did was ask for a 20-minute warning and it never notified me. Please fix this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Timeful which they bought and were supposed to implement was so so much better. I could resize events into tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Total garbage. I really don't get it why they needed to change from Reminders to Tasks. Now I don't get reminders, even if notifications are all set. Recurring tasks just flow by, and don't just flow to the next day until done, and I need to go back in time to find them. Useless. Why change a working system? Need to find another app now which works - and preferably not buy this company! Disappointed 😞"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Lack features that other reminder/task apps have. Please add SEARCH feature/icon, PIN at the top certain tasks, and REPEAT task in HOURLY & MINUTES. I have to make the same Tasks just to repeat hourly. Please add these features soon. Three stars for now."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"oh, you know I love everything by Google I'm so appreciative I cannot express it enough honestly."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"App updates make this app worthless. Why would you only show the task the day after it was supposed to have been accomplished? Makes no sense. Worthless. Not even a setting for notifications anymore... What is the point?"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very Good 😊"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I'm sure other people have good experiences with this but it's been truly awful for me. Whenever I set a reminder, I expect the app to send a notification, but this hardly ever does."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The app is basic enough that it can be used, however the functionality gets weird when trying to enter tasks that repeat but the first due date has already passed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Somehow this has fewer features than the prior version."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"definetely i will change my review in future. but now we can improve,such as notification color, which we know what task is going on , can add colors to list and categorize them. we should be able to add task time frame (such as you have to complete with in this time) . can give a added stopwatch/TIMER to tasks for exact mili second(as pro version). and also when tasks completed it should show as achievements. just some ideas that could improve overall performance of day today life i think."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"no search option?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is for adhd. Not for regular user"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This app is pretty straightforward but there are few things here and there which would help tweak the app to be better. 1. The conversations which you have with friends being added to tasks and calendar seems to get kinda buggy at time or not work at all. 2. It would be great if we could rearrange not just the tasks but also the lists to our preference."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Okay best apps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is a great way to keep track of important must get done tasks that are not as important to record on your calendar but important to get done at your earliest convenience. In this days of fast pace life for some of us and even for all of us at times we tend to overlook or put away the little things not as important however we tend to forget to get them done and this is a wonderful way not to forget the little things in life that we often missed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I don't need it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like this format. easy to add quick reminders to calendar without having to create a detailed event."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,""" Okay, Google, remind me to submit a review for the tasks app at noon."" Back in the day, I would get a reminder at noon when I said that. It worked flawlessly and did exactly what it was supposed to do. Now, I get no reminders."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Things I do not like: - No sharing tasks or lists with other people. - No standalone webapp, only on a narrow sidebar in Worskpace. Google Keep on the other hand has both of these features."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's great, it's not perfect. For me, I need simple, easy to create, and easy to complete reminders. Google tasks do just that. The app UX is classic Google, but in some ways, I feel this is outdated, and that's the only reason I didn't give a 5-star rating."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great... But Atleast few more features, And Keep It Clutter free and Simple"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Constantly doesn't remind me of things unless I open the app. The notifications don't work over half the time. Might as well just use the notes app if I have to open an app to just read a list of stuff to remember.

I really wanted to coordinate this with my Google calendar and it doesn't sync.

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminders forced me onto this nonsense. I have actually missed timely reminders now. Why doesn't this app even work on Wear OS? Who thought that was a good idea?

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Needs to have more features to keep up"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it tell me what tasks so I have"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"notifications don't pop up, so this thing is only good if you remember on your own to check it. defeats the purpose"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app is so valuable yet so limited in function. I use Google Calendar so I do try to stick to the system however the task app doesn't allow you to organize the listing in order. You have to swipe quite a bit to get to what you want this is especially troublesome if you are like me who has numerous lists that I like to keep separate from everything else. Thus the one star for making it all such a chore!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Can not delete tasks, even the ones two yrs old. Even if you mark them completed you can not remove them. Two much clutter."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I wish there wasn't a VERY easy to press button that completes ALL incomplete tasks that forces you to uncheck them one at a time. That would be nice, great improvement over reminders google, thanks for the extra effort you put me through for no reason."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminders were better. Notifications for reminders stayed around, tasks are just displayed for a while and gone, that's why I've missed a few things because of this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Counter productive"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love it ,great app ,great ui ,simple to use .has easily become an integral part of my life"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy and simple for every day use. Just great . Thanks again Google .. and when you think that i was boycotting you just 2 years ago .. but congrats for all this free tools that you re giving to us ( us = ungrateful brats)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Does the job but could do with more features to make it ideal."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Can you give me the app.pleas"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,", ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Sooo helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very convenient and much easier than handling tasks in my calendar, but they are there too. Really recommend this app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Ok. Not really feature rich - doesn't really do much above the default Google tasks. No annoying ads. I like it and use it because the widget is better than the default tasks widget."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Out of nowhere my reminders aren't working. I wish I could go back to using Google assistants reminder system before they made us switch to this garbage"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It's ok. Reoccurring tasks should display again after completing, and I should be able to reorder tasks as I like. But the biggest sin, especially for a company known for search, is the inability to search for tasks, both within and across task lists, including by status, such as overdue."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Please return tasks to how it was before it became a separate app, especially the snooze button."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Unable to download app always stuck on 95%"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The main thing I used reminders for was setting location based alerts via Assistant. ""When I get home remind me to XYZ"". Now reminders is replaced by Tasks, I can't do that any more. This app is a step backwards over what we had before. How can an app that needs to do so little still manage to be missing features?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Bring back reminders. This Tasks switch over has been an embarrassing trashing of functionality, while screwing up everyones work flow...just so reminders could become less customizable & nearly useless? Once again google removes whats useful in a product and leaves a shell of what it was"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's great to sync with the Google calendar, it boosts my productivity"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"add schedule and alarm option for the tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"so far so good. I really like the interface and it is easy to use yet efficient 5/5"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Please add transperant widget"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app made my Google Assistant even more useless and I didn't even have it installed. Setting a freaking reminder shouldn't be that hard"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Thanks for ruining my whole reminders/tasks system!! I had some I specifically wanted on my calendar and others I wanted in the Tasks app and now you've merged them all, my whole system has gone wrong!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Muy bien"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Completely unreliable. Less than a 50% chance that I'll actually get the reminders I've set. Is it too much to ask that if I set a reminder, I actually get a notification at the proper time?? Apparently so with this app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"doesn't always alert me when it is supposed to. I also miss location based reminders. I was nice going to the store and getting a reminder to pick up something specific."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app !!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Remove the reminder feature and compel people to use this instead, but it doesn't have the capability to change label colors for each task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome app! Really helping me stay organized and getting stuff done. Loving that Google home will automatically add to task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I'm not getting notifications. YES all permissions are granted. When I set a reminder via Google assistant or if i add it manually on the calendar app, i get notifications just fine. If I set them using tasks app, i get no notification! Very weird. It's nice that the app organizes the tasks, but if i don't get a notification when the task time is due, it's kinda defeating the point of reminding me on that specific time. Please fix it!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Decent but it has a funny way of handling recurring tasks. When you complete them, they disappear until the next recurrence. This is counter-intuitive. I would like to be able to see ALL future tasks including recently checked-off recurring ones."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Super annoying that all my reminders were forced into tasks which don't have the same notification options. In fact, I don't get any notifications even though this app is supposed to support them. This one issue makes this a useless app for me, even though I'm forced to use it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Absolute downgrade from Reminders, which was almost perfect. Notifications frequently break, calendar integration is mediocre at best and SEARCH DOESN'T CARRY OVER TO DESKTOP, constant duplicate alerts, sync issues, overall buggy and barely usable. Interface is clunky and annoying. It is really amazing that in 2023 we still have to deal with software this all-around bad. Google seems to be completely dedicated to only replacing good apps with terrible ones."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"need more features"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Total waste. Horrible. I'm actually angry and I am generally pretty even tempered"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Actually garbage. Been using reminders for years to remember my pills every day, but everything was switched to tasks automatically and I haven't gotten a single notification since. Missed some doses. And the option to add tasks to my calendar doesn't even show anywhere. It would have been nice to know that my reminders were going to a different service that doesn't work, before it happened."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"ok but lacks sharing lists with family members"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Me gustaría que tuviese una opción de añadir prioridades y poder ordenar en base a ellas. Que tuviese iconos también ayudaría bastante a clasificarlas"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Does what it's supposed to do. A lot of previous complaints I have read in the reviews seem to have been improved. Ex: someone said you can't order the tasks the way you want... You can you just have to hold your finger on it and drag it to what order you want. Another person said you can't see your tasks in the calendar anymore and I can still see them there. ECT."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good ui. I was expecting better reminder experience. sometimes i dont get notifcations for my tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy to use - integrated with calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Perfect but I hope more widget sizes"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminders that no longer remind you! What a great change!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Lackluster; Blah ; Meh!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Really usefull and easy in use. By the way, it connected with others Google Services. BUT I suppousing that Google can use your data, which you put in this app WITHOUT your permission. So please, be careful! 8/10"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I need it before it I used assistant reminder. I more features needed for upcoming tasks eg. 1 year ago,6 months etc. Good application."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The notifications are terrible. The button ""mark as completed"" in the notification doesn't work. The notifications disappear after a few hours and sometimes pop up only once I've unlocked the phone. Overall, bad experience. The old reminders from within the calendar were much better."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Can be better just too basic."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"portable and sharable memory"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Once you delete a List, even if accidently, which is super easy, it is gone forever!!! There is no recycling bin!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice and clean"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Weak"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Life became easy. I would appreciate if you add ""search"" option."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"invaluable"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I didn't get the reminder for my task today and it didn't appear on the Google Calendar and Tasks. It has successfully reminded me for months except today. Not only I couldn't get the reminders previously on Google Calendar, now I don't get reminded of my tasks that have been on Google Tasks all along."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Can't set order of your lists. More importantly why waste your time on a system that's going to get rearranged into some other app a year from now"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Muy buena"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"missing some features and, like all Google apps, could be cancelled at any time. * would like tasks with sub tasks to be repeatable. * would like the task list to be accessible similar to calendar using a secret link. there's no reason one should need to use the Google API to access this feature."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Wonderfull!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Love this app, but latest update broke sorting :( It used to be sorted in order of task creation time, new tasks one the top. I opened today and yesterday tasks are winning the middle :( So frustrating :("
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app, nice notifications, syncs well with Google tasks. But adding subtasks is often difficult - they hide below the ""Mark completed"" bar just out of view and don't automatically become visible when typing."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app for organising my lists. Only downside is that I can't access it via my laptop, just my mobile and tablet."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"works well, should be able to set a task reminder by location (i.e., when I arrive home, remind me to...) please consider that feature"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Making my daily life easy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No sound no pop up"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Useless app. At first, it did show notifications, then it stopped, whuch simply defeats its purpose. I've cleared cache and data. Even reinstalled, and nothing. My phone is running on the latest Android."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Can't share task lists. What a waste of space."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app is terrible: it duplicates all the notifications I already get through Google calendar, only it has less functionalities than Google calendar, so I have to get rid of the notifications twice, and I don't get any benefits at all from having Google tasks, just nuisances. Uninstalled!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"well organised app and simple to use ...helps me keep track of all the tasks for the day"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Unfortunately since the conversion from reminders to tasks it has totally messed everything up. My reminders are now in the wrong categories but I cannot even change them. It's just terrible. I'm looking for something else now. Very disappointed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and get the thing done! Exactly what I wanted."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Google Keep Reminders are much superior to Tasks. Bring back the ability to show Keep Reminders in Google Calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works grart"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminder notifications disappear after a few hours. Never happened with Google Assistant."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I really rather it connect with my gmail. Not sure about efficiency yet. Nothing to prompt your memory."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great service for those who forget appointments!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"BUG: Using Android in English, tasks will use a US style date selection popup, where Sunday is the first day. This should be selectable like in Calendar, not language specific. FEATURE REQ.:There should be more organization options, like labels. There should be an option to tie a task to remind you when you are at a set location. And an option for recurring timed tasks like one a week water the plants, and recurring until done, which would keep coming up as a notification until it's marked done."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Reminder notifications are not consistent, so what's the point? most of the time I have to open the app itself and then suddenly I'm bombarded with all the notifications I should have gotten at their set time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I don't understand why you would get rid of location based tasks and only keep that functionality on Google Keep. Using ""hey google"" for location tasks was extremely useful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I like to use Tasks to stay on top of recurring bills. I use the widget for Tasks to review them. It is dynamic yet simple. It is a good app. However, I give ⭐⭐⭐ for this: whenever I finish a recurring task, the program hides the next date until that day comes. I'd like to be able to see ahead on the widget rather than open the app and view the completed task for the next date."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It would be good if there was a way to reorder lists, such as move a list from position 3 to 2, etc"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Much better than the old ""reminders"""
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Why to move tasks from the calendar into a separate app? At the same time when you killed music app and are killing podcasts app to have unrelated types of content in YouTube app. Google is loosing it's mind."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps to keep me organized. Excellent app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"doesn't send me push notifications"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"increased functionality would be good. such as take the best parts of Todoist."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I used to combine tasks and reminders for a very simple purpose: I labeled work assignements as tasks, and everything related to free time as reminders, purely to have them separated with different colors. Now that reminders have been taken away everything is mixed up and suddenly you only have one way to label everything in your life. Even the simple feature of being able to make individual tasks in different colors, in the same way as with events is absent, which now makes ""Tasks"" utter trash."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"superb app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Useless. I have yet to receive any notifications, even though my notifications are set correctly. Without notifications, it has no usefulness. Do better, Google."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is the best to-do app. I use it every day. I use the ""Tasks"" application to manage my professional, for example, the milestones of a project; and my personal life, for example, the errand I have to get when I come back from work or during the weekend. I also have a widget for the application on my phone's home screen. This way, whenever I pick up my phone, I get an overall view of my tasks. PS: If I were to request one feature, I would love to rearrange my lists on the top bar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"very simple, i like it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"why don't I get notification of reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Horrendous! Why fix something that isn't broken and then make it broken? My Google home speaker now has a persistent notification light because when a task is marked as complete on my phone, the speaker doesn't care. So annoying! This worked perfectly fine before the switch to tasks for reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"First you force us to use a separate app from the calendar for reminders, redundant since they still appear inside calendar. Then you create an app that is completely unreliable at the one job it has makeing it completely useless. To add further insult to injury, the address for support that's listed is no longer monitored, showing how much you actually care. I guess the only recourse then is to leave negative feedback here, which was probably a waste of my time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Rubbish. Recurring tasks. Once marked completed it doesn't show up on your list until next occurence due date. Yet all single occurrence task appears in your todo list. How does anybody use this"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Replaces sticky notes while out and about. Useful while checking email and need to add New tasks. Love it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Transition from reminders to Google tasks is very confusing. Really don't have a clue as to methodology/ next steps. I'm not even sure if/ how I can go back to using reminders which was fairly simple once I found them."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great for my use, my only wish is that a Task List or Task could be shared."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Some long-lasting feature and quality-of-life aspects of the app have still not been addressed, since first the first release version (cannot switch the fist day of the week in the calendar independently of OS setting, no warning message when deleting task lists and no undo option (!), etc.)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Set a reminder to cancel Amazon prime membership, but didn't show any notification and Amazon auto debited my money. Worst app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"They changed it. Absolutely no notifications for reminder tasks. Why does Google insist on breaking things that work perfectly?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I sure am glad that my reminders or what they now call them ""tasks"" are all lumped together regardless of relevancy. Used to be that only current and pending reminders would show up, but now I see every reminder in the future for literally a century. Why"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Add previous tasks history"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Now that you can set reminders and is visible even in Google calendar is a good app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminder sound is not working many times. Worst Google.. being such a big company, inconsistent app.. shame on you"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"There is no way to completely delete tasks that you've done and no longer have to do."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Suggestion: 1. Need to add start date and end date for each task and sub task created, 2. Replace this app with Keep as a system app, 3. Task List should be able to reorder"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it's a good app but some seems to be missing or this app may be made more easy."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It keeps not actually sending reminders so I keep missing things, the old Google assistant method of tagging it to calendar never let me down like that 😢"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's a great app, keeps routine well"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"For recurring tasks, why did you completing one date leave all the other in complete section? It should really create another event /task of the same name and put it in not done, with the computer one under complete"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It hides the next occurrence of a repeating task under ""completed"" until the day that it is due. Therefore you cannot easily see upcoming instances of recurring tasks. This makes it useless for planning ahead. Calendar shows these correctly. Why not Tasks app? Just show the next instance under upcoming tasks and the app would be great."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No notifications when I set a task/reminder at all. Defeats purpose of the app, wish they never changed it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Would be much better if new tasks could be created by dragging down the UI tiles panel from the top of the notification bar -- Microsoft To-Do has it, how hard is it for Google to develop one?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Much better than the old reminder app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Super usefull for organising reminders and tasks quickly for short to long time periods. Have been using for a while and really like it! Use it almost daily."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Google used to support creating shopping lists that would be automatically tagged/sorted by category, so all like items (fruits, veggies, packaged goods) we're organized to make it easy to shop. They removed that functionality AND prevented 3Ps from integrating w assistant. Please restore it so I can use the assistant and Google shopping list again for my grocery trips"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great App Overall 👍😁"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I dont use the default task lis and there's no way to delete it, nor a way to make any of my own lists the default. Let us organize our lists!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works great!!! I like how well Tasks works in the Google Workspace environment."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"little very life insurance"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Three things that would be useful, integration with Microsoft to-do, hiding off far off tasks from the list (tasks that are years in advance), and a PC application. Microsoft to-do syncing is a big one for me because I'm tired of having to pick between two ecosystems, Microsoft owns the PC world but Google has always exceled in other areas, I just wished Apple, Microsoft, and Google would finally properly come up with a proper sync model for basic data."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Highly recommend"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I do not like any company knowing my information."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"best"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The last update has ruined everything. I lost information of all my completed tasks which I used to refer for my completed work. Please restore the previous version at the earliest."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Very bad app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Due to ADHD I use reminders 10x a day so I'm highly invested in what Google gives us here. This app feels woefully incomplete, e.g. you can sort by date but can't reverse the sort to see the latest at the top, no search (really Google?!), adding a time is clumsy (no tomorrow button?) etc. etc. etc. These are basic features we expect in even a minimum app, never mind one we're being forced to switch to. At least we get dateless tasks now (thank you) but you can't add them with assistant... Sigh."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"A great app for a person who is very busy and needs to keep things organized pretty useless to those of us who aren't that busy though"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reoccurring tasks still show as completed instead of showing new due date. Makes using the entire app pointless."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best app specially when you have Google hub"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Its not reminding me of reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Lack of appealing widgets"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very useful"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It would be nice if there was also a restore all completed tasks option so that we can reset daily checklists."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"not bad for being useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Absolute garbage"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I stored all my saved classical music short concerts (over 400) on Tasks. Without warning, task closed and made unavailable over 300 saved entry's! They're all lost and unretrievable. The site refuses to answer my requests for help. DO NOT USE THIS APP! 9/24 MORE CAUTION I just found another group of tasks that the Task app has erased STAY AWAY FROM THIS APP! 09/27 Now I find the Task app is closing older entries on all my lists So annoying I'm loosing lots of saved items and no retrieving!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No reminder or notifications which kind of forfeit the name of the app. Pls bring back our calender reminder..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No notifications appears. Reinstalling and checking notification settings is no use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's nice to have, and connects to Google calendar. Like that I can set dates or times for my task, and can have them repeat. Don't like that subtasks are not indented and grouped with main task. It just pops up as a normal task. All dates and alarms are not added to the subtasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"There isn't a way to transform keep reminders into tasks, so this app is useless"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This Tasks app is brilliant"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't have alarm. Useless."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helping app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"útil, lo uso todo el tiempo"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"7/29/22 - It would be useful if the notifications weren't so inconsistent. It seems like every so often, it will just decide to not notify me until I actually open the app. 9/27/23 - Gave it another shot with the same issue. The tasks simply don't pop up unless I open the app, at which point all of the notifications I've missed will pop up. Notifications are probably 75% of the point of the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"really a good to do list simple and easy to use. I like it alot just becuase I'm not overwhelmed by the app itself and let's me focus I appreciate that I went through like 20 apps plus to find this one it's great"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Naej job"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Completely ruined reminders. No simple way to mark all past tasks completed, which means if you don't manually tap mark as completed for each task, they just build up over time. Also, used to be able to snooze reminders. Goog ruins another good product, very believable."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very good app to maintain productivity"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It boggles my mind that Google's Tasks app can't do shared lists like Microsoft's can. You cretins are too busy collecting and selling our data to bother with implementing a basic function into arguably the most important productivity app in your suite. Pathetic"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It's doesn't have text reminders, no bright colors for categories, no great sounds. Too bad we can't have a spoken reminder. And I want to be able to see upcing tasks along with completed tasks. It's just not enough"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"quick and easy way to remember Todo stuff and time lines.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Me permite gestionar mis tareas de una manera sencilla e integrarlas en el ecosistema de google que utilizo para gestionar mi calendario. Hay que fijar fecha en la tarea para que aparezca en el calendario. Y la agrupacion por listas sin agendar me ayuda a gestionar las tareas a largo plazo y dividirlas en secciones de manera mas util."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please add a search feature! Otherwise I do like the simplicity of the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Make a sound when we tick on task complete"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love how simple the app is!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Can not stop it sending old stuff that it finds"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I've loved this app for a while, but lately, its reliability has been inconsistent. Sometimes, notifications do not show unless I open the app, which defeats the purpose of a reminder for me. Also, I have yet to receive a notification for reminders requested through Google Assistant. As above, I've had to open the Tasks app for notifications to pop up."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy to use simple, not much details can be added though, cannot categorise tasks or give priority but maybe not necessary. sometimes overengineering is bad for an app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Such a stupid icon. For me (and I would assume most people) a tick/check sign means something is completed. It is so illogical to have a tick as the icon as I keep thinking incomple tasks have been competed (specifically when shared with google calendar) Makes it useless for me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It is impossible to see the scheduled recurrent tasks in advance. Even one day in advance I do not see that something repeated is waiting for me to complete. Por favor. Edit(24/09/2023): Not a problem anymore."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Bad Avoid"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Can't believe google killed the keep/reminder calendar integration for THIS. I uninstalled tasks many years ago because the mobile app lacks any sort of configuration feature. Nothing has improved to this day, yet they're forcing calendar users to use this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"With this app I never miss an appointment"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The best of all"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Intergration with Google assistant is quite buggy and anoying. Using pixel 6."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"focused, handy, integrated into Google products"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"i want an app where I can track my daily routine, and after I mark it done, it appears next day again. But it is unable to fulfill that. moreover, i want a time tracking system as well, so that i can track my time for some particular activity. and i want a systematic analysis of my past records as well. this way i would be able to know whether i am efficient or not. but this app is not able to fulfil my requirements."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Absolute trash. Now that my calendar reminders were changed to 'tasks' I cannot see all of my upcoming tasks in one place in the app. I had each of my bills set to certain monthly or bi-weekly schedules and had the ability to edit them all at once if a date changed, but now I have to go change them individually? It makes no sense and is time consuming. Please switch it back or actually make this app function. This is one of the most idiotic changes I've ever seen."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awsome I like it!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"can be slow to load and buggy integration."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I tried to use the tasks on my s22, it recommended this tool. I found it to be absolutely useless. I had to create and delete and recreate one task many times before it was functional, and then it didn't remind me today. Investigated to find out TASKS had once again changed it from a weekly reminder to a daily reminder, and it doesn't send out the reminder unless the tool is open. I much prefer the tool built into my phone. It runs in the background and works perfectly I rate this ZERO stars."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simplest task app. I have tried many hard task apps and most of them were either too complicated or just very not user-friendly. As I am somebody with ADHD hands down this is the easiest to do / task app out there."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very helpful and useful. Helps me to stay focused on my priorities."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good 👍"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Notifications don't work sometimes. There is no search function. Google calendar was able to search reminders and tasks but Google took it out."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"BEST 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Dear developers, kindly provide us an option to search tasks within the application.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Wonderfull 💥"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"What's the point of giving the recurring task option if said task disappear from the list and never show up again when completed??"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The app doesn't have any premium features, and I bought the premium to help me stay organized."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this is a lifesaver!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not a fan of this new set up please bring the old way back!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I use it all the time. simple and clean is the way this is making me feel, tonight ❤️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This thing disabled itself. I have not been getting notifications in the past few weeks for no reason at all. When going into the settings it said the app was in a deep sleep. How could something that I use literally every day go into a deep sleep as if though I am not using it at all? Please give me an alternative to use to this garbage along with an alternative for every other Google product on this store. You guys have really went downhill."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I would not make the task dissapear if completed, I would add an option to cross it off"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Keeps one up to date with the daily task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Don't know what I would do without this app. So customizable!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It would be great to have a countdown feature for the tasks and fused with the widget too."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it'll be good if I can tap on Google calendar to schedule the task instead of having to press the plus button. The task feature also does not appear on the tablet as compared to the computer. If the task can be stretched on the Google calendar so that it can be used for time blocking. Also reminder sound should be allowed to change since default is too short and soft. also allow for labels or tags to allow for sorting by different categories like Microsoft list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"RTM is much better in organizing many tasks that are part of project. Read GTD!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very satisfied and interesting page"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Going to work hard"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Can't attach anything to the task, most other apps have this. Why should I use Google tasks then?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Please add search feature asap."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This is a terrible shift from the old Reminders system built into Google Calendar. It's extremely buggy and can't handle changes to recurring tasks properly / seems to behave inconsistently between desktop & mobile. Basically unusable now."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I don't like being bombarded with review demands"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works well for my needs"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps keep my hectic mind a bit more in order. When paired with the pixel watch and a timer is set. The reminder keeps me honest and unsure I complete the task at hand. Of course, based on the key factor when used properly."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like it but please don't put recurring reminders in the completed section, makes me worried they won't show up next month"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"nice easy app, but no way to set priorities"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I love the simplicity and functionality of this app. It would be great to be able to change the order of the lists though. I use it everyday to keep on track of... life."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Need a way to share task lists. Deleted tasks need to stay on the same position in the list, but be seen as crossed out. Never delete completed tasks!! I need to refer back to them."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Okay. Unique elements poorly executed. Like sub tasks; there is no clear indication on your task list whether your sub task is part of a bigger task until you click it. Requires you to make the subtask title so descriptive that there is no point using the sub task options. Should just have the sub task slightly indented or colour coded or both as options... would be 30 seconds to implement... not sure why basics like this have not been polished"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Garbage, keep reminders!!! I hate this app and much more prefer the reminders app. Now I have to find a new app altogether."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great way to stay organized"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great tool"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great way to stay on top of tasks and appointments. I give 4 stars because I wish it had an automatic preset for reminder, obviously you'd eant to be reminded in advance of appointment not at the time of appointment which is the automatic preset it provides unless you change it manually. Reminder should automatically be set at minimum 24 hours prior to be more user friendly. Otherwise it is a great app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"seems like a giant misunderstanding of how people use to do lists. go back to user research on this one and reassess the feature set entirely."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't pop up reminders at the scheduled time. forced to switch to this since the closure of reminders and its awful!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't notify on screen for reminding. Not at all useful. Uninstalled."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"You should provide the possibility to attach some files or possibility to link with KEEP"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Another one for the graveyard"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Doesn't block time on your schedule when you create a task, only a full-day event reminder the day it’s due. The due date in Google Tasks is simply the day the event is scheduled, which may not be sufficient for planning time-intensive projects. Simply want to block the time needed to do the work"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Notifications fail to show constantly. This really defeats the purpose of a dedicated app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great for productivity :)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I was happy with reminders!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"1 c"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I think this app is very helpful for managing tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app from last 3 years. It is really saved my time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great tool! Simple, clean and easy to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Absolutely brilliant. I use it everyday. Makes up for an average memory"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love ❤️ this motor coach and song"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The reminder Needs more work. Once u missed it, It will never remind u ever again. I think it should act as an alarm clock wherein it won't stop not until the user has acknowledged the task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent tool for on the go tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It would be a perfect task app if it features sharing of tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google I can't say anything more because here is everything you can do, search about maps and in any other part that you search for, Google will give it to you and show it to you."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Not as good as the old Reminders app. Tasks often doesn't show me reminders at the scheduled time so I've missed several things that were important since Google changed apps."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love how I can have repeat tasks and check them off and they will show up the next time I have them scheduled. It can be daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, annually. It's awesome!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice and simple."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Pretty good. All I have tried have shortcomings. Color coding would be nice as would five level prioritizationing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"can't live without it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Compared to other similar apps it lacks a bit of functionality, but all in all a great app.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Absolutely saves my life!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Integrates seamlessly with Google Calendar and Gmail views that I already use daily. Exactly what I was looking for in a light weight TODO list app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"notifications do not work on time. asked to remind me at 7 pm. Notifications came at 1 am next day"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app. Why I haven't used fully before, I'm not sure. Have deleted other paid for task apps. This one is free, doesn't drain battery in background. Saves to cloud. Integrates with Google calendar and Gmail. Is simple, effective, easy to use. No frills, but fantastic. Hopefully it stays this way. Thanks Google 😀"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good for quick, simple, sequential to-do lists."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Clunky and not user friendly iendly. I miss google assistant."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not reminding me of the task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"You can't even snooze the reminder simply. The old reminder format was fine, until google forced it automatically to google tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Please, add the basic missing features."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love the app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Just Amazing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Actually a really good app for it's simplicity. Write or speak them in there, broken down into its parts or not and check it off when you're done."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good simplicity."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Know if .. .nna$!* 444♥️jn. ,na, #,nn🏊‍♂️👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Tasks don't regularly show up as notifications timely."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Used to work fine. Within the last month I no longer get notifications for tasks. All the permissions are on and to draw over other apps, nothing is blocked. Super frustrating when I run a business and can't remember everything."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I can't sort the task lists as I want. They are always in the order in which I created them. or just this feature is not so obvious. I can’t move the reminders that came from the calendar to another list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I AM PREPARING FOR JEE ADVANCED AND THIS APP HELP ME A LOT FOR MY TIME TABLE AND IT EASY TO OPARET IT ....👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"There's no option to set reminders as daily, weekly etc. This app is bare bones and not useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not excited to have to download an app to do what I was already doing. Less is more. So already starting on a bad foot. I'm sure the app will be functionally fine but pointless so only kinda sorry about the 1 star. I don't understand why you would remove a feature just to promote a new app that is the feature it was doing away with? Will probably end up deleting it and making due without the feature. My phone only has so much app storage."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app to help you remember. Necessary."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"app doesn't always push notifications to phone. have to open the app at times to force it to send notifications which isn't helpful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's so dang great 😃👍 and doubles as a pretty neat notes & goals app too.🙃"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"satisfied"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I have memory struggles and rely heavily on the notifications for tasks to remember what i need to do The app hasn't notified me anything when a task is due This is frustrating as i need a reminder or i will forget and never get anything done"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice app, easy to use and pretty intuitive."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I love the ease of making and organizing tasks and being able to check them off."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"meh"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It's not possible to view upcoming tasks (when I have a repeating task and mark today's as complete) besides going to the Completed list and scrolling down to try to find them all. It would be nice to see all upcoming recurring tasks in one place. That, among other things that have been said to death by other reviewers. I hope Google listens to the feedback. But I guess most people only use it for the most basic functionality, which would explain the 4.x rating on the Google Play store."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"There is no provision for advance reminders. I never used tasks in the old app. I prefer the reminders. That being said, I'm opting out of the entire Google calendar and will utilize another calendar app that suits my needs. As others have stated.. you folks need to listen to your end users."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Notifications for tasks due is lacking. If the notification comes thru and it's not completed it disappears and does not keep populating. I do like the fact that I can have different types of tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Definitely helps keep me on task, LOL so to say"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I don't know how to do about it Google Task list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very helpful app, just one thing bothers me is, there is no option to add duration for any task. As the tasks are synced with my calendar, having a duration will help a lot to check my free time in just a glance."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Useless application. It doesn't show notification on the right time instead it shows 4-5 hourse later. What will I do of this application if can't remind me what I need to do on the set time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Your to do tasks in a Miracle Tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It's annoying that I need another app to manage tasks because the UX is so bad in Calendar. Reminders were good enough, I don't understand why they were removed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome! Love my new cut! Thank you Jo Lee!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Unable to find an option to share task with others"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I lost my reminder from my calendar, this app made me lose a lot money, it did not notify me at all from the reminders I moved to this BS App I hate you"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple, efficient, effective..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good for time management"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Clear"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Red Chile"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Really wish this app had a share/collaborate feature. It's the only thing preventing me from giving above 3 stars"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"You shouldn't have merged Tasks and Reminders. Please separate them, like before."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good application"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Was hoping this app could replace what was lost when reminders got 'innovated' out of existence."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love it!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Useless! No reminders, no reacoccuring tasks, why even bother making it? I downloaded bc I saw it beside my google docs as an option and thought it would be useful for when something popped into my head as I was working, but alas. 5 years later and still no. Also why is it not available for Android watch but is for Apple???????"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"so far so good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"noice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app, useful one"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"does exactly what it says. its fast and simple good job"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Very little ability to customize and setting reminders either doesn't work or have some too-subtle way of reminding you because I've yet to have a notification or calendar event or pop up of some sort tell me that a task is due. Can't seem to find any settings or menu to change it, either."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I think I like the app because you will never miss an app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Not great. Yes, it's free and part of your Google account, but it lacks even the most basic features that come free with other tasks apps and task managers."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A really great application that smoothly integrates with Google calendar. I love being able to look at my calendar I'm being able to see the information from tasks as well as contacts all in one place."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ĺove anything that makes my noob easier"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminder not popping up at right time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's A Very Useful App! Love It!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"If you have subtasks on you cant repeat a task and vice versa? DUMB What if we want to have a recurring task with subtasks to repeat why isnt this an option regardless of cluttering the days, it just makes it simpler than adding subtasks as a full task and cluttering the days anyway? come on bro other than that it does what i need it to do but also i cant even change the order off my tasks in my days because it goes of the ascending order also? with no arrangement option and idm time allocatio"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"You took away tasks and gave us Keep, which I use but now I can't use Keep but have to use Tasks again?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Keeping my files storage"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"marvelous"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I just had a territorial dispute when th my ADVERSARIES demons recently, and their demons wouldn't even acknowledge them. Fix their issues. Dig a whole and berry the chute. HUCK. is there ever enough crime, to the sound of VIOLENCE....... but FIXED."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"amazing app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love it, it would be great if you add an ""due today"" and ""over due"" tab.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"works fine and intuitive options to make separate lists. tough to delete a individual task without marking it as done"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Simple app for task management. It should have the option of archiving the list them deleting it or something similar to Gmail"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It's missing the basics to be a productive app. I'll uninstall for now."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Bring back the Snooze and the ability to edit tasks on the fly, right from notifications"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Got a weird notification from Android systems saying the app was requesting permission to access my account now and in the future. Not sure why it would need this as it's already tied to my account. So I said no. Hoping it doesn't mess anything up as I can find nothing about such a request. Also not a fan of tasks replacing reminders. Do not like the way tasks works in comparison."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This is actually a very useful app. It does a lot of what I need a basic checklist to do for me. I like it partially because it's not so complicated and doesn't have a million different. It does desperately need the ability to share & collaborate on list. Please add 😉"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Clean and solid interface. A great addition to the Google ecosystem."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Thank you so much."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google is so good at doing this everybody should get Google she is so unbelievable she can change voices she can do almost anything it is so good you guys should try if you haven't tried Google you have Siri or Alexa you should actually try Google because they have they have good stuff"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I have no experience with this app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Some UI need to more spicy/colour full required"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Incomplete tasks need to continue to show on the list, regardless of how old the task is. Otherwise, what is the point of having put it on the list in the first place? Being hidden after 30 days helps no one. Aside from that, whatever, its a pretty bog standard task list that happens to be the one that Assistant can integrate with."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Not available on Google watch"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It fulfills its objective perfectly, it is the one I use and will continue to use."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The main purpose of this app is to provide the planned reminders on scheduled time. However, it is not serving its purpose, and gett8ng skipped the defined allarms on a routine basis. Totally disappointed 😞"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like how I access my tasks across all my devices."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like it although I feel I choulde be optimized better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Default list shows the subtasks separately."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This really helps me complete my tasks, with the reminders and the way each task disappears when I check it as completed. There's something motivating about watching the checklist dwindle as I complete each task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good if task could be shared with family"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app is a disaster.After forcibly moving my Google Assistant Reminders to Tasks, my once organised stress free life is now a disaster! The reminders simply don't work properly especially when used with Google Nest. At the moment the only reminders that even show in my notification screen are repeats. BUT even these randomly disappear at midnight! Then if i open Tasks, the Reminder notification icon disappears from the status bar thus NOT reminding me!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I like the way this app is organized. it is very visually clear to read. I gave it 3 stars because it doesn't take account of the date; I had to remove old tasks and add tasks.

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple and easy."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Since the migration to Tasks, I have not received notifications regarding scheduled tasks. Premigration a reminder set for a specific time would trigger a push notification on my phone AND a notification on Google Home devices. Now, nothing. It's kind of pointless to set reminders if the app doesn't actually remind you."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"By Joseph Edward Darling"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome program to keep you organized."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I'm not sure which app to use ""Reminders"" or ""Tasks"" because they provide the same exact service, except ""Google Assistant"" uses tasks. the problem I find with both is that you are not able to set multiple reminders based on the time. In the ""Calendar"" you are able to set multiple time settings to remind you of whatever event your trying to remember. Not everything entered in the ""Calendar"" makes sense when needing to set multiple times to it. Please add more options in ""Tasks"" or ""Reminders"""
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very convenient on The Go!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Rinders limited. I like how events allow multiple remonders, but tasks is default for ""remind me"" on google services. Please just add more reminder options to google tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I really really like this app, but the fact that recurring tasks only show up on the task list the day they recur completely defeats the purpose of putting them in the list in the first place. I need to know what tasks I have due each day so that I can plan ahead - I don't want to be blindsided by weekly readings or weekly assignments that I have not completed the day they are due."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"App notifications are not consistent. Reminders app was so much better."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"it sends me notifications for my tasks 4-5 hours after I scheduled the reminder and sometimes doesn't send notifications at all. would not recommend as it is literally less useful than just using the calendar in your phone."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminders far superior get rid of tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Cannot see tasks from multiple accounts in one lists. No way to delegate tasks (Unless from Chat or Docs somehow). Reminders in Keep are separate from Tasks! Also Reminders in Calendar are displayed separately from Tasks, how to create them? Also no way to add links to a task. Would be very helpful if I could link a Keep note or a Google Document."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"rubbish. wish I could go back to old google reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It makes it too easy to accidentally mark a task for later today as done"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Really love this app. For competitive exam, this type of app is helpful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't even send notifications at the right time, making the app pretty useless."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"cool"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Luv it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this app. Vary clean, looking, and it being a google app, it was very easy to set up and start making a list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"There is a big problem in your app i have made a time table for me and I have added many tasks for everyday in sequence but task gone always unsequence 😡 if I short task there come only 3 option 1. My order 2. Starred recenty 3. Date Please add these thing 1. New to old 2. Old to new Because my tasks are for regular day there date i Will not select"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The widget doesn't show correct date, for example if I set a reminder for tomorrow, the next day I see the task from widget it still shows tomorrow, which can be a little confusing and might miss out some task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very Interesting Google Task And Google LLC App ETC."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love the app. Can create multiple lists. Can navigate between lists by scrolling left and right. App is very simple and useful Integrates well with calendar. One thing that is missing is to have an ability to see all tasks for today (across my task lists) in one place (in an automatically created list similar to starred list). This is needed because even when you are not able to catch up with all tasks across list, you can see tasks for today and will not miss important tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Limited... Guys, it's 2023. Why can I not share task lists with other people and put them in my calendar? Good lawd, in its current state this app is just high-class sticky notes."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It would be nice if this just had a spot that all of the task you have that day would join to one spot daily and then this all would be perfect. Maybe I just have not figured that out yet. But otherwise fantastic!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love everything on trak"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Best"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app in combination with Google calendar is a must-have for efficiency. The addition of Google tasks have made me so much more efficient. I have been using other apps to attempt to make myself more efficient and this conquers them all. I do wish it had the ability to share with other users to allow collaboration."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Pontos positivos: simples e prático; fácil de usar. Pontos negativos: 1) poderia haver um modo de visualização de todas as tarefas, independentemente da lista em que estejam (uma alternativa é marcar as tarefas com estrela, mas creio que esta funcionalidade serve melhor para destacar ou as mais urgentes ou prioritárias de cada); 2) no calendar, as tarefas para determinado dia poderiam aparecer agrupadas num só evento, como acontece com os lembretes; 3) as tarefas podem ter subtarefas"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Reminders do not send a notification when you set them. If you ask Google Assistant to remind you of something at a certain time, it does not remind you. You have to look at the task app to see what your reminders are."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Search function seems to be lacking. Crucial for me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"More is expected of google. Main Idea is to make people productive. Absolutely no focus on this app. And is kind of slow"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Very unreliable! I primarily use this to remind myself to take a medication every two weeks. Sometimes the reminders don't come through. Why did Google create a solution for a problem that didn't exist? And the solution sucks!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Hi i am ther"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good basic task app. Easy to create. But why are sub-tasks appearing as separate tasks without any date time once your save them??? Isn't the point of a 'sub'-task that it is linked to the main one?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Wish reminders could be location based"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I like this apps is simple and good buy there's a problem about the widget because when I turned off my phone for a sleep the task is gone and I need to redo the widget please fix it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Didn't work out for me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I like the simplicity of the app. It's a check list and you can order the tasks by date. I really dislike how little flexibility it has. I want to but can't: snooze a task to a later date (have to manually change the date), re-order items in a day when they're in the date-sorted view."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Google task अच्छा ऐप है लेकिन इसमें improvement के chances हैं जब मेने task में time edit किया तो अगले दिन वह amended time पर ना आकर same उसी टाइम पर नोटिफिकेशन आया जिस पर initially save किया था। Only for a day,,, amended time valid रहता है फिर वापस वही time जो starting में सेट किया था उसी टाइम पर नोटिफिकेशन आता है। इसमें एक और bug है कि इसमें यह पता नहीं चलता है कि कौन-कौन से टास्क छूट गए हैं या अधूरे रह गए हैं Pending task is not shown"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's what you expect and what you only need"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Okay for 1-off tasks. The support for repeating tasks is so limited as to be unusable."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Updated? Material Design? I don't see it. This app still looks like a third world app, especially on my Pixel Fold. You've given us absolutely no reason to leave Microsoft OneNote."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like this app better when it was Google reminders because it was location-based as well... This one will let you so I have to use Google, keep to keep reminders and tag them to remind me every time I hit a location... Which is a little ridiculous"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The application exhibits commendable functionality; however, it would greatly benefit from the inclusion of a feature that allows users to designate the individual responsible for completing a task when marking it as completed.

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"One of the worst app is Google. It remained dormant all the time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Notification issue"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I've loved tasks since I started using it, but all of a sudden you decided to merge tasks with reminders. I used to be able to put reminders on my calendar without choosing to put tasks on my calendar. I would like to go back to having my tasks and reminders separate so I don't have to have my entire chore list on my calendar but can have my billing reminders on there. Why would you lower the abilities of your programs? This is super inconvenient and unhelpful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No snooze function. Notifications for reminders not coming through (which is the point of the app) reminders was better."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Why remove notification for these things?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"super useful and simple app. integrates with Google calendar and is also on desktop. doesn't have too many extra stuff in it. also no ads. it also gives the great feeling of being able to cross something off your list when you finish it. I use it for homework or anything else I need to remind myself to do."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Free version is very simple. All the features I would like to use are in the paid version."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Should show per day view"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellently developped. Best thing is if it integrates with Google Workplace."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Extremely basic. No tagging, attaching files, marking completion dates, or other entry level features for apps like these. It isn't even as robust as Google Keep. Very disappointing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"his new minor diagnoses menopausal symptoms"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like the simplicity of the interface, nothing to distract you. Good overall but lacking some features. Needs recurring tasks with recurring reminders, ability to collapse tasks with subtasks, ability to set reminders for subtasks, ability to reorder lists in the header and reorder subtasks, and WearOS integration."

I think they can add more features, such as: recurrence per hour, for example, taking medication... this cannot be closed because it only has a day, week, month, etc... another interesting feature would be to be able to share a task with one or more people , then this can give you a perfect order for tasks that have more than one participation... putting colors in the tasks, is something that without great complexity can help us organiz"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Awesome 👍😎"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love how easy it is to use. I can quickly develop my to do lists for work as soon as items come up."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"user friendly"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Replacing Reminders with Tasks wasn't a good idea 😕"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The app is great. However, on PC, tasks is only an extension on Drive and Gmail. It's not an extension of Keep, which it should be. Also, it needs its own standalone website. Three stars."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"After sometime"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google Tasks is much better app than it's predecessor Reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Please I do not want My Task to go out to the Public only my Family Members. If you put my information out to the Public I will not use this App in the Future."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I would like the option of seeing the check marked task before it is swished away. I would prefer to have a second step where you can delete task when ready."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It hasn't got an option to unsubscribe"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"this lacks critical features for it to be useful. you cannot clear an entry from a repeating task without deleting all of the items or marking it as completed. what am I supposed to do when I miss an item? there is no easy way to adjust the schedule of future items."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"for the past few weeks, every time I try to open the app, it's incredibly slow and never actually loads. it just gets stuck on the full-screen logo. part of the functionality of tasks is being able to add things quickly on the go so they can be remembered. the mobile experience has been nonexistent (when it used to work fine)"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for optimum productivity....."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Stop adding apps and removing functionality from google calendar"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"if accidently someone swipe and removed notification there is no way for it to remind again also no quick settings tile"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Useless app,. Without a reminder setting to beep hours or days in advance they're is no point to having this. I want to be able to set reminder to my convince. This app will just tell you last minute when event is happening."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Shared List and Assigned Task PLEASE"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work at all. I never get a notification. I've been through every troubleshoot list and nothing. Worse than before."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I can't give this app enough 1 Stars. You changed reminders and events in the assistant and now it just doesn't work. Despite having notifications and allowing background activity the app still just doesn't notify me of my reminders. Making this app and the Google assistant completely useless."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Download,update,install and rate to the latest version of the app to connect,provide,protect and upgrade to the highest quality of the products. And also,keep it safe and secure from any sensitive information,attacks,unwanted software and all inappropriate ads,contents and situation that are not useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No way to share lists and todos with someone else. Repeating reminder management is horrible. No way to manage them unless it's near the time of the next occurrence."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Cannot share tasks, lame"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Its a very simple task app. Have no collaboration options, and no widgets. You can not duplicate tasks. The main problem its the ""Google Suite"" security and privacity. This app dont have own login. Uses your phone google account. If you got hacked all your google information are in risk. Same with Google privacity they have a lot of data about you, and giving more data seems not convenient."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I just want a list. keep reminders out of these lists."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Please make options to reschedule! The inconsistency is not ADHD-friendly and it sucks because I want it to work - the seamlessness across Google Workspace has been a game-changer. But without more reliable reminders and notifications, options to snooze, etc., I have to rely on a secondary to-do app 👎 This app would be top tier for so many users if you add these features back in. Bard is a thing; have an AI option built in to help with time mgmt like every other reminder app."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Almost perfect!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Overall good. Use it to sync across my calendar, and android phone and macbook. I'd want something more like a kanban, with a nicer overlay and UI And also a search bar!!!! Would take it to a 5 star. Otherwise does a job, simple and basic.

Also, there are times when I know I have a reminder set, but don't see it, only to open up Tasks and then I'm suddenly blasted with 5 reminders that never alerted all at once. It was as if I asked the if I got any messages while out and the app just said...oh yeah, I forgot to tell you, you have alerts. 🤦"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"i wish my tasks would automatically go into Google calendar as reminders. the tasks app is easier than calendar, but it doesn't alert you, not can you set alarms or notifications for a specific time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Recently I discovered that I have tas ks on my phone. I'm only beginning to find out all the interesting things tasks can do. I am looking forward to using tasks to it's fullest potential."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"would love more options to personalise, eg colours for list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I can't get my notifications to alert me aside from a pop up on my screen."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful for Time management. I will suggest this app to all, it is better than notes and reminder."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Old reminders through calendar app was way better. Tasks are difficult to edit when recurring."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A great way to keep track of my daily tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Helps me with planning, quick and easy. If you didn't mark a task as completed you can finish it later so you won't forget. Still figuring out its full potential. What I miss is a labeling like how time it costs (short/medium/long), basically agile planning."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Make it more user friendly"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it is nice to have a list of tasks right on your phone too remind you of your to do items."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Like"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"❤️🇧🇬 EARON KHAN 🇧🇬❤️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It would be great if you could add tags or categories to tasks. I'm currently in school, so having a tag for each subject would be really useful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Request Features: Any chance of shared tasks lists between apps? A new section where reoccuring tasks are listed instead of them disappearing to Complete and potentially being deleted. An option to bump a task to the next day."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Why oh why oh why is there a difference between a repeating task, and a task with subtasks? Seriously. Why can't I remember the 47 and building list of a specific set of things I need to check on every time I check on that list of things? Why is something only allowed to be complicated when you do it once? And why am I getting notifications at 3:11pm for a task I scheduled for 12 noon?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful app 5/5"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A great app, especially when using a shared email account to live update lists and tasks."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"google task just shows notification when we check, it should make notification as alarm does."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Very bad Can not access Google Cloud Android Mobile Canada apps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple yet effective"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I would prefer an app that I can shuffle the order of the lists, no just the tasks inside the lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"isn't notifying properly"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"A good task manager. Unfortunately, it lacks the ability to sync with other calendar via open standards like CardDAV!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Suresh h c t yf"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Agree with others, needs a few more features."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple. does what it should. I dig it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Lovely app but she issues as with Google calendar, the widget options are so limited, how can there be no transparent option, no font size options or discount etc. Better widget options need to happen ASAP. Still no transparent option for the widget!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Does not sync to watch. Stopped sending reminders to my phone. Google Assistant worked way better."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Don't remind about task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It helps a lot to remember and complete your tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Don't like Google getting rid of reminders and forcing us to use tasks. If this was a good product we would have been using it all along. There needs to be more options in settings, especially notifications. We should be able to choose sound, volume and time of day."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"not sending reminder notifications"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome 😎😎😎👍👍👍👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"There is no option to change the order of the list. And the widget are not optimised."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app is useless, seriously. I create a task to do not forget about it, but I forgot about all of the tasks. How? Because there is no notification, no sound, nothing! After the week I checked the calendar and I saw that I have 5 uncomplicated tasks and that's it - this is the only info what you will get about the task. What is the point of setting up the time? It is not the time of reminder, because there is no reminder. It works like having a to-do list on the paper..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Reminder notifications are not showing sometime"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Add more widgets and give options for adjusting their transparency."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not worth it peace out"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"When reminders were in assistant, i used to get reminded with notification without any problem. Now I don't get that and often forget about my medicine."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"another underrated Google product"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app to keep tasks. Easy to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Too simplistic. There is no even a recurring task option."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"i just wanted to add a gmail to Google calendar as a reminder, from my phone."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Notifications should give they option to reschedule, not just to mark the task as completed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Perfect app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It's basic and relatively straight forward, could really do with the ability to skip or postpone recurring tasks. Could also do with notifications for outstanding tasks otherwise you have to go back to the app to find them. Shared lists like Google keep would be brilliant."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it's very very good but I hope that the feature of not completing the task and why it was not completed will be added"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is good app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"recommended"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love being able to keep up with things I need to do by using Task as opposed to using my calendar. I just say Ok Google state my task my task date/time and I'm all set."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Verygood :3"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Pretty good 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Grid view of all list would be more better to have eye of more number of lists."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"There should be an alarm instead of a notification."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I don't get notifications of the reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"need a desktop app or standalone website"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is recommended by Google tips and suggestions, I'm so grateful I gave it a shot. Well worth the time utilizing it. It allows you to get organized, motivated and implement your plan."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The best apps are the simple apps. This Google Tasks app ticks that box. But it would be best if I can attach an image to a task. Two stars only for now."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Darn thing never worked correctly! JM"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I wish google calendar, Google remainders and Google task was integrated well and not separated. Messy system without user friendlessness."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"more options like infone task could have been better,"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"There should be a 'Search' functionality."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I wish it had a ""remind me in X"" custom time period button for the notifications. otherwise it's a slick and no frills reminder app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I want it to keep reminding me if I don't get it done and I wish it had a distant sound notification at the very least so that I'd hear it better and be prompt to get my task done."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"With notifications permissions off, I received a notification every ten minutes until I uninstalled the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for the past five years, it is a wonderful app that helps me remember my patients.And house sale Salaf, i.e. household goods, also helps a lot in remembering, due to which a person is saved from wife's scolding.I would like to say to all my friends that this app named Task by Google must be downloaded."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I can find everything"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Utilizo constantemente o Gmail, que está interligado ao Google Tasks. É um aplicativo com funções simples, é útil e fácil de manusear. Minha experiência é satisfatória."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not good enough"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"User friendly, very convenient, and just the perfect App for daily tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Push and pop-up notifications don't work unless the app has just been recently opened - unfortunately the app is pretty much useless for this reason. I have tried everything. This is a common problem. Please fix up, Google!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Somehow has poorer functionality than Google Keep's checklist feature. No support for subsubtasks/ double indented entries, poor UI, and the web sidebar version has a non-dismissable popup at the bottom when you check off or delete something, covering up the bottom entries until it goes away on its own."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Congratulations Google, you've ruined reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"नं"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Wanted Features: Time Duration i.e. 9:00-10:00 Customizable Colors and Sounds Auto Organize List by Time Tasks do not disappear after finished I would like this to function like Events in Calendar that get checked off essentially."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Horrible, no notifications. There is no point in installing this stupid app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"does the intended work"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I wish there was a way to have the task reoccurrance be based on when it was last completed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Hard to add & subtract tasks. Hard to navigate around app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I'm used to something more effective and user friendly. Anyone know how to make this app audibly alert me when a task is due? I've been late and/or missed 3 tasks so far. Just isn't reliable enough for me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Half the time it doesn't work, making it super unreliable. Why did you ""fix"" something that wasn't broken?! I used google assistant for years to remind me of things, now it's useless. Please fix this! Btw, I've already uninstalled and reinstalled with the same issue."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The app stops sending notifications after a day or so unless I manually open the app. It is completely unreliable for the job it's supposed to do. It was much better when it was a part of Google assistant and not its own app. I have checked the settings to ensure the app permissions do not get removed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"too limited"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"the size of the letters change during the day on vivo x90 pro (China version, android 13). other things are cool"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"works decent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Sometime it fails to remind on the time it was set. And sometime it doesn't even reminds the task on the set date and time at all..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"such a simple reminder turned into a complicated ordeal. miss the reminder app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"the most useless app that ever came out of Google. this company is quickly becoming a joke with got disconnected they are from the actual user needs. absolutely zero useful functionality presented."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I would like to reorder my lists (not just the tasks). Should be merged with Google Keep. Thanks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like it a lot but it can be better- please add an option for the google assistant to say your tasks, make new ones and lists!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I love the simplicity of the app and it has exactly all the essentials that is necessary, however I give it a 2 based off lack of organization. The Lists function can not be edited for reorganizing once they are created. They are locked in the same exact order they were created in. Don't have an after thought for a list or choose to decide to group similar/common lists together. The way it's currently set the entire list must be deleted and then readded in a functional order. That is horrible!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Add the ability to share the list with other users."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"african"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Why is there no set up for notification"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It should give the option of strike the task rather then hide it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"some how I'm not getting notifications/alerts"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I hope it could looks nicer on the widget"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"everything I was looking for ! I used the GTD method and it works great with it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminders are not reminding at the time they are set for. Had a reminder set for 7AM. Didn't not pop up in notifications until I unlocked my phone some time afterwards."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Removed reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It's just bad. There is no today view to see the important tasks that need to be done today. They'll show you all the tasks you have. All of them in one place. No organisation features. They made it just because they had to have a todo app, not a functional one though."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Looks promising 👌."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very very friendly app to use and make your day routine discipline"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Pode melhorar muito"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple but effective. Integration with Gmail works great!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I need more to give acurate data"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome app! Helps me get things done! I ca also add my reminders to tasks!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This is good app, simple and lightweight. But there is one drawback, which is the lack of integration with Google Keep. Quite disappointing, considering I often use Keep to create reminders. This integration could be great: Tasks could even grab all the checklist items in Keep notes, add due dates, and so on."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's OK, but there's no way to add a person to share the task with. I would like to share visibility with someone else on certain tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"limited functionality"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"manpower chapter 11"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Get my reminders days later. Bad app, made me miss a bunch of important things"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"in task application sub task are showing with main task it is very confusing. subtask should be showing when click on main task only. (i.e. when click on mail and thanafter open mail contain same like this sub task should not be showing with main task)"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A good app for reminding👌"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great organizational tool."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"No Android wear version?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent way to keep up with your tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"DOPE"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Easy to use, but hugely unreliable. Would love to use for things like setting a reminder for a few minutes when I set a cup of tea brewing, but there's every chance the reminder won't pop up until hours or even days later. How can Google release such rubbish software?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Faulty and odd! I started using tasks with the elimination of reminders in calendar. It's okay but I noticed if you want to change a recurring task it will only change the task on the day you selected not the future ones. I also don't like that an unresolved task keeps it original date as completed even if it was only done later."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It was better when just Google app handled it. Notifications aren't working like they used to. I've made sure of all the settings but I don't get notifications at all"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice APP"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"overall is good but the widgets needs to be improved"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very useful app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Really love this app. But it could be better. Like more features and much better UI."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"apps didn't give alarm"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"best but not making any difference from notes you can combine this like Google Web calendar and please introduce the tables and links like Notion I gave a low rating just to grab the attention sorry for that..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and easy to set alarmed tasks. Relatively simple"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"App is buggy and does not send notifications at the scheduled time, even when app is set to keep permissions and app has not been force stopped. My reminders only show once I physically open the app each day and they only show upon launching the app, no other time. Edit 8/20: the app updated and worked perfectly for 48 hours then reverted back to not notifying at the set time (if at all) and all permissions are correctly set. This is a horrible app and one of Google's worst app changes."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Just installed it; opened it and no help whatsoever on how to use it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"💸💸💸💸💸"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"No Problems"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Wow...This have exact features I have been looking for..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Super"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Remove"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"A reminder app that stops sending notifications. Go back to the old google assistant reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I'd love to be able to time block my tasks. Not every task takes 30 minutes. Please add this feature."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I don't know what happened but I can no longer rely on this. Notification is usually 20-40 minutes late. This started about a month ago. Very disappointed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Bubkijo10 kgionjohn"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I lost one of my reminder notifications in the midst of the Google Task implementation crossing over..missing a dentist appointment. 😒 Very aggravating. Now that it's fully integrated I don't seem to have any new ""tasks"" missed. Outside of that one issue my experience with Google Tasks has been good 👍. Well developed, solid integration. I use it with a Google Pixel 7 Pro."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helped me be more productive! Love this app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"alarm not added.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"too hard to cancel multiple tasks at a time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"doesn't work!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"add ringtone set option"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Mostly not reminding me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Just started using this app ONLY because Keep Notes (Reminders) no longer show on calendar. I shouldn't have to ""recreate"" what I had in Keep Notes all due to Google changing to Tasks. Not only did I have to install this app but now have to take the time to put all my reminders into Tasks so they show on my calendar.....very time consuming. Both apps are essentially the same thing so why not have just converted Keep Notes to Tasks automatically??"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Feeling well dinoyski"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This is the most dumbest to-do apps I have ever used. I has very limited customizability, widget sucks for the most part. I really wanted to use this app because I use google workflow for my daily and academia life. This is the only app that is holding me back."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Write a review.wahhhh opt-out"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great tool to keep focus of key activities 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Needs to be more refined. Addl features to be incorporated."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"No search feature. Simplicity is good, but this is too basic."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"If people would seem to keep people out of my personal business I could manage tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Stop breaking features that used to work flawlessly! I bought over a dozen speakers, 3 watches, countless phones, 4 Chromecasts, a Stadia, Google voice credits, funded Google wallet accounts, many domains, GCP apps, etc... all expensive Google products/services that I purchased based on existing features... And then Google kills them, confusingly renames them, or just sunsets the apps entirely. This is just another example. Reminders from the Assistant used to work, now it's unreliable chaos :("
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Widget doesn't work properly, gets stuck and shows old tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Rahhhh"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Been using Reminder on partner's iPhone and it's far superior to Tasks. Would also be nice to not clutter my calendar with daily tasks. I'm guessing It's not worth the approximate $50/year for the pro version since this version has issues."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Integration with Google voice assistant is abysmal."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"unable to set ringtone for task. it just reminds us silently."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"keeps me on track!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great Overall, just missing customizations of notifications and reminders for each task notification."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"delayed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"tq for this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"My hope is that this is more polished before Reminders are sunset. Currently, this app displays the message ""can't reach tasks"" along the after tapping on most anything. Uninstalling for now."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Muito bom, mas poderia ter mais funções como cores das tarefas, quantas tarefas repetidas foram realizadas entre outras funções que iam ser mais fácil de visualizar de forma mais analítica."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Plz add auto delete for completed tasks by number of days"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"you need to add lists, check boxes and icons"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"👍👍👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Not much features in the app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"okay"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent Tool for your task tracking 😘"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I wanted an app that can work in tandem with google calendar but with additional features. This is just one extra step to add tasks to the calendar. I would love it if tasks with subtasks had a repeat option. Would honestly make all the difference for me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Google assistant would notify you of your reminders but this app does not notify. For you to see your tasks/reminders. You have to always open the app. Google assistant was useful and helpful, you never missed any reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Please add a task step and can be checked to indicate the task step is completed and also sharing task to other user"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works really well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best to do app I have ever used. Google is one best software company. It make you have several list of tasks and each list with its own group of tasks. I have a business task list, a school Todo list, a contact call back list. This is a very flexible app. You can even reorder your tasks in any list. I wish they can make the starred section adjustable"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Love the app, especially its Google Calendar integration. One suggestion: please add the option to set custom task reminder durations. This would help with my time-blocking strategy."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Bring back the reminders! The alerts don't pop up at the time I set them for, so this is absolutely useless! Horrible ""upgrade""."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice, useful, easy to learn as a newcomer from an iphone background. But more improvements can be added for sure."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Why can't I create subtasks when I set the task to repeat? Weird."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"definitely the best way to keep track of lists of things using tech this far ❤️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Absolutely useful. I like the way in which tasks are entered and monitored. The only thing which I don't like is on the desktop, when I try to add a task the new desk comes at the bottom. it should have been at the top."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love this app! helps me prioritize my ""to-do"" list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great App. I just wish you could archive lists so you could go back if you need to"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"keren mantap tapi sayangnya ga built-in sama Keep Notes"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I love this app for it's simplicity, the way it allows me to manage my To-dos, and the ability to schedule a time for them. My only ideas for improvement would be if you could share tasks at both the list and individual task level."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Like the simplicity. What I miss is simple: I would like to see tasks I marked as complete today, but hide them day after (move to archive). Instead they immediately hidden in collapsible list and stay there forever, until manually removed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app and very nice app"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Needs some extra features and it will be the best minimalist tasks app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"All I can do is create a task...that's it. No lists, no anything but a bunch of task/list titles and no way to add information. If there is, maybe you should have put some kind of help or instruction. Uninstall"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This App sucks! I wanted to use this as a daily planner / to do list and it's just not possible. You can't change the order of the lists on mobile and you can't automatically order the tasks in the list. It's very limited. I'm gonna keep using Google keep, that app is so much better and customizable."

You don't need to put ""update todo list/review/configure..."" in your task manager on your task manager. There are also convenient tabs under which you can organize tasks based on subject, person,etc..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It displays notifications for my reminders with a delay. Old reminders were better."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Can't print a list. Can't export a list as numbered list for word"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"could not add sub task that repeats everyday"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"add a notes segment that would be great like i dont want to download google keep"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very impressive but please make a separate ringtone for task so I can hear easily and don't forget to complete my task or reminder. Make it possible to see my tasks while phone is locked through google assistant."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this should be all integrated into one Google assistant platform. preferably updated with the new generative AI previews and all the other LLM features that you got cooking up"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"need auto paste and copy feature"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"No Shared tasks and no search function"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's OK. I wish I could puck one company to do everything on my phone! We have Google, our phone manufacturer and the carrier to deal with AND if you use Samsung add dear 'ol Bixby to this list. What a waste of our storage, all this competition on our phones!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"100% garbage. Do not install. Do not trust. This app does not notify you of your task. You may as well use a notepad app instead of this. I thought this app would track my tasks throughout the day and it did not send any alarms or notifications or reminders to alert what task I needed to complete next. Uninstalled this bs."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and helps me keep track of my tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works perfectly."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"does what it's supposed to do!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Task works well with all my apps. I really enjoy it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"App is slow, clunky, and really ugly UX"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"my life would be a mess without this lol"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"unreliable and buggy. doesn't show notifications!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This is a downgrade from reminders. Google is changing reminders to tasks. It's ok for solo user but now I can't share tasks with my family members like I was able to with reminders. There is sharing but it's business/work oriented. They need to add sharing, sub tasks (like Google keep list) to this or add calendar support/ reminders to Google Keep lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice apps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"not too customizable"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Actually love this app as I use it daily. It helps."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"if option of strikeout is given it will be best"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Improvements: 1. Enable quick task deletion by implementing a swipe-to-left gesture. 2. Allow unlimited nesting of tasks instead of restricting it to just one level. 3. Introduce the option to add color to tasks for better organization and visual distinction."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Just sync keep reminders again with Google calendar. Tasks is very basic with very bad UX and UI. Who developed that app? Is it a school project?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"better than reminders. I'm used to working tasks in Outlook so I like this better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Give me a watch version"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"strangely screenshot can't seem to be shared with Task which makes Keep the more attractive option still...bit of a mess in my opinion."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"One option i feel missing its must be added in repeat task option that is ""time"" task need to reminde every specific time in a day. Example i need a task remind me in every hourl. Plz insert this option update thanks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Confusing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Looking what I see 😊"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"add reminding alaram option"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Since you changed it to tasks, it doesn't work!!! Bring back reminders.. Uninstalling finding something reliable bc I've missed my medication several times bc of this"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I have a reminder for a certain time every day. More than half the time it doesn't show up at all. It is frustrating because this reminder is for medication. Was better when Hey Google was doing reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"OK but reminders take too many steps Setting a reminder on Google used to be a quick process. With Tasks it's now a bunch of steps and you have to tap ""done"" to set a reminder date which is really confusing. Needs to be more streamlined. Overall it's decent though."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I'm not getting my push notifications. I rely on Google assistant and these reminders to keep me on track throughout my busy days and through my ADHD."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google is stealing my personal information 😂👌🏻"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very well to do Krishna conscious taks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Recurring tasks ONLY appear on the day they are due. If I want to see when the next instance of a task is (i.e., plan ahead - the WHOLE POINT of a task list!), I have to scroll through ALL my completed tasks to find the last time I checked it off. From there, and only there, I can see when the next instance is due. There are many complaints about this, from 4+ years ago, so I have zero hope that Google is listening (to this at least). But it's the dumbest thing, to make a task list this way. :("
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Usefull app, nevertheless, would be perfect that have the option to personalize the colors of tasks in the Google calendar app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Does what I need. Recurring tasks FTW!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Love this as a task management app. It integrates well with other Workspace products. Two additions that would take this app over the top: 1. A day at a glance option. This can sort of be done in Google calendar but it would be nice if it were integrated into the Tasks app. 2. A Material You widget makeover. I love having the Tasks widget on my home screen for easy access but it stands out right now as the only non-Material You widget."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app somehow blocks notifications of tasks. They are now managed in Google calendar. You can add/edit them from this app but I don't get push notifications after installing. I still get the notifications on my other phone and Google home devices. And sometimes a push notification will appear if I open this app, but no timely push notifications without manually checking. A Google search shows and these reviews reveal I'm not the only one with this issue. Uninstalling"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Welcome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Productive"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I'm a very visual person. I hope we can add colors to organize task. It's TOO simple."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very useful app especially when you are working on google space."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"There is no way to see all my tasks in one place for my multiple Google accounts, which makes it hard to manage everything. There should be a view similar to the Gmail app’s “All inboxes” feature. There is also no way to see upcoming tasks/reminders. This seems like a glaring omission."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Wonderful to have please: 1. Search Function 2. Function to move or duplicate a task from one account to another > I'd be excited to chat through examples on the above recommendations 😎 Other than that, Google Tasks plug-in became my daily and long-term vision board. Efficient and Effective. Thank you for the products you create that are impactful 💪🏾"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"My first time using the task app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Has Ghost tasks that don't exist but show up as notifications."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"would be better if lists could be shared for group projects"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great job great app I can keep up with everything this way 🤗"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"💯👍🏾😍🤩🎈✨‼️❕‼️❕"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great concept"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Does not send out a notification all the time. If you forget to acknowledge a repeating task and the notification drops off you will never get a notification again. Don't know how this is better then a calendar event."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A good task management from Google"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"ishares acct phone number."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"GOOD"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please update the widget with material design. It looks horrible on android 13"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I set tasks all the time and my phone never reminds me. I have triple checked my settings. I wish they had never changed it. Reminders always worked for me. What is the point of having these tasks if the phone doesn't remind you to do them when you need it to??"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Similar to many of the Google apps. You can count on this to run seamlessly and is easy to use for even someone like me... PS: Google Tasks works incredibly well with Google Calendar and many of the other Google applications. So, if you're running Google or have Gmail I recommend this for sure."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Needs a widget for all tasks that are due today or this week (or some specified time period like that). There should also be an option in app to have an overview of tasks across all lists."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"when mobile is extrazooming, like in repeat option of tasks, saturday not showing, but i need my phone zoom bigger and make days option more little when zoom is bigger, there's a lot of problems in the app made it not satisfying, but still apperciate it. Thanks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"limited, i can't use percentage instead of mark. i can't create a repeated task that select multiple days within every month. i can't add subtasks inside a repeated task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"If you're gonna get rid of Reminders, then you need to fix Tasks. There needs to be a way to have a task WITHOUT assigning it a date. Those are the ones that need to roll over each day into Pending tasks. Dated tasks that were not done, are called Overdue tasks. Pending tasks should have a general notification setting where you can pick a routine time for a ""reminder"" about them each day. Each Task needs multiple reminders you can set (that WORK) regardless of whether it's assigned to a date."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The task widget doesn't work, it only shows a few tasks and sometimes nothing at all. My order of tasks randomly resets and gets reshuffled. Notification for tasks and calendar doesn't work, it mostly doesn't notify me but sometimes it does but it sends multiple reminders at the same time at a random order at the wrong date and time. I can't believe this was made by google"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"work's well"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I love and use this app a lot but it needs to avoid losing notifications everytime it is updated. After every update i have to reschedule notifications in order to get them back. Those notifications are reminders to complete tasks so please fix this issue. Thanks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Microsoft To Do is much better. I'd like to know when I created a task and when I marked it done. I used Google Tasks for many years until 4 years ago when I realised it wasn't the best of the two. Now I'm forced to use it again because Google decided to yet kill another feature I use, Reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"por fin algo simple"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Very good tool but lacking many important features such as sharing list of tasks, importing, copying, sorting alphabetically, adding shortcuts, etc. Hope u can improve. Thank you"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Lack functionalities compared to previous tasks in Google calendar. An unfortunate step back. No possibility to pick colors making identifying tasks difficult, no option to set time zone which is particularly important when Gmail only offer to create tasks and no calendar events, which is what a meeting is. Very basic and after all that time it couldn't make it in the application."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, helps me organize all my tasks and provides proper reminders. Also is synced with the cloud, so tasks can be used from any device. The option to rearrange the Lists should be added like in the web version."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simpe and good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works really well and keeps all the things I need to do that I constantly forget in order, like my reminders and my groceries list, my doctor's appointments and Abby other tasks I would like to create on it. it's easy cause u can either put it in yourself or google assistant will do it for you also."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I just want reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"One star for forcing this very inferior app on us instead of Keep reminders - e.g. it's lacking the ability to search, it's lacking labels."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"best google calendar plug-in"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is a great way to stay organized!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Reliable, but notifications aren't as good as Google Keep reminders. First things first: Google Keep is the better app for notes and reminders. Better formatting and better reminders make it a winner. To the Google team: Make sure that on pixel phones the ""At a glance"" notification link for upcoming reminders takes you into the correct app and not into Tasks for reminders made in Google Keep! It's currently the only problem I'm seeing and it's huge since I vastly prefer Keep. Easy fix."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't notify unless the app is opened."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's quite sexy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I am grateful to have discovered Google Task. it makes my student- mom lifestyle much more organised. I feel lucky to have find it at the right time. Keep it up"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Finally integrated into Google Calendar and schedule tasks can be repeated, which makes Google Tasks usable. The caveat, can't sort tasks alphabetically, task with subtask can't repeat schedule."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Well done"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I am thankful for this list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Its a great app, with very fluid interface. The only feature I find missing is, being able to reset the tasks after a certain amount of time. Lets say I use it as a checklist for my daily goals. My goals repeat everyday. Its cubersome to go and uncheck them everyday. Could you please work on that."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"does what it's supposed to. Plus syncing it to Google calender help."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please add actual ringing alarms. Like what was the point of moving reminders to tasks. There's no new actual features 😮‍💨"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"did i win"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it does make life a little easier just to know that the things you say to yourself I need to remember it doesn't for you as long as you tell it great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"good to go"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I just downloaded this app. It was easy to use and organize my task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Can't change week first day"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app is too basic. Hardly any features that are useful or aesthetic. It doesn't even have a sorting or moving option to adjust the lists created. Microsoft To Do Lists is just better in any regard, but I'm forced to stick with this because of the Google ecosystem. I hope Google Tasks will soon receive an update with additional features. But for now, a big thumbs down 👎"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"There should be an option to move an already created task into a list and options to add comments and track progress on each task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So far so good seems to work 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I sometimes don't get alerts of a task. I have to open up the program then it alerts me. It's the point of having a task program alert me of a task. I don't know why it does not alert me all the time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Seems buggy nowadays. Half the time it fails to notify me when I've set reminders and doesn't until I manually open the app, which defeats the point."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"bad service it should be with alarm or with sound"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it would be nice if I could add descriptions and details to the tasks, so far it's too simplistic and minimalist"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Great app, I just wish I could set up tasks on my mobile devices through Google calendar like how G.Calendar works on PC."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and track tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Open"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The app is great. simple and clean interface. but it lacks a lot of functional features."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"make task widget 3×2 and 2×2 and 2×3 plzzzzzzzz"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Forfeit ""da"" funds in2 mein bagie"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Add capability to snooze the task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is really good, setting the date works very well, particularly for repeated tasks there are a lot of options available."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"For those who are all seeking productivity and time management.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A grocery lìst."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Feels sloppy. Glitchy and unfinished. Extremely limited functionality. They took something that was working and broke it by turning reminders into tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Don't ask me if I want to review your app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Puede mejorar esta app, crear las tareas por los calendarios que ya se tiene, eso ayudará a categorizar las tareas, además que sean de diferente cooo"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A Very good way to organize my life."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I'm visibly being organized since I started to use this and I couldn't be happier about it!! 🥹❤️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"T̶a̶k̶e̶ t̶o̶ l̶i̶s̶t̶"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy and helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"a really cool idea waiting for new features 😁"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"My Google reminders used to work fine, but now they're forcibly migrated to this ""Tasks"" app and it just doesn't do the basic functions that I require of it. I used to say ""Hey Google, remind me to wash the car in 2 hours"". But now regardless of what I say, in two hours time, it'll just pop up saying ""Tasks will provide notifications going forwards"" and I have no idea what the hell I was meant to be doing."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Garbage Glad the new and update reminder app doesn't actually alert you of schedule tasks. Absolutely useless."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Wwas"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very convenient from Unit to unit"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Bring back reminders!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"When I turn on dark mode on my phone, the font remains black in widgets 🐸. Please correct this. Also, could you consider adding the option to add new tasks from the bottom instead of the upper part? This way, the old tasks won't be covered by the new ones."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love this"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excelente"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this is a really clear and concise way to do lists on your phone. i like the different lists and times too"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Overall it's pretty good but it keeps deleting the text i write in the description. It's super annoying and unreliable."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Previously I used Google Reminder in Calendar,which was a good provider of doing ""what it says on the tin."" It allowed one to input monthly, yearly or weekly events. Following the reminder one was able to address as completed or the reminder remained on screen until either completed or deleted or amended to new date. TASK which superceded Reminder is an inferior product as you cannot amend or cancel entries made. Poor replacement for the original Reminder."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Is really good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it is such a productive app and easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Ommmg., to get eg Xu ugh fffh gf gf"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"After the last update Google destroyed it. You can't get the reminder to work, you can only get half of your task, It won't tell (speak) your task to you like before as in the reminder and if it does, it tells you only two or three, whereas before it would speak every one of them...What a mess. Bring back the reminders like it used to be."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"👏"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Banging with google nest"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Quick and simple"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Half of the time my reminders don't notify me, and I'm sure I've got all the permissions turned on and I've allowed it notification settings and put it on as a never sleeping app. Also, unlike the old reminder app, it doesn't let me snooze reminders for an hour."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I love the app but I would like it better if it would actually notify me (alarm) of my tasks not just have a bubble come up."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"If you add tasks, expect ads about that task immediately."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Absolutely useless. Feels like made to collect your data rather than being made to be useful. Notifications doesn't work. Reminders doesn't work."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and very user friendly, you don't have to go searching for things and other abilities are right in front of you guiding you through the whole process"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"very Useful app for Day to day Work"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Works with Assistant! Very nice!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great keeps me on track. 1 place. Thanks Google"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Does not integrate with Google calendar app, also lacks many basic features that come with other task apps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"happy Birthday"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"about time this app is available"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good journaling companion."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Needs daily tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Very minimal features. Please add some more features. Also please add an option for sharing a list. UI could be improved"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Any app that prompts me to review it on Google Play gets down rated. Especially when the prompt interrupts me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Like it when it works in conjunction with email."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Cool app with wonderful user experience."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Ok but isn't this kind of the same as keep notes ?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Needs task archive feature ASAP."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Neat interface, but it never seems to actually send me the reminders as a notification without me opening the app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I gave 4 stars and not 5 cause I can't share tasks with someone else, other than that, it's a great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helps a lot while you are preparing for exams and have to remember syllabus etc."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good, but not perfect.. unable to Remove time once set"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple y útil"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Where are the snooze options for tasks that pop?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"not at all intuitive. i liked the old system because of its push notifications and now i don't see how to make a voice reminder give me a push notification anymore. i have to go back to doing them manually. extremely disappointed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It's a stupid app, it alert the reminder too late, and i demand from Google LLC to fix it as soon, Thanks 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Hacked"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Am very good in business, u can only call me if you have business, am very good in my work I do wat I no how to do most Wich is my work , am orch Lagos"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"35 minutes ago"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Wonderful task list. Straightforward and easy to manage."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Would it be possible to have the percentage of task done displayed to the user It will be nice to have this feature"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy, simple and good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app to be on top of things"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is really helpful for me for planning my daily targets btw I am a student and I must say this app is best for my to do list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's a very good app for personal task management. Just having one more feature of allowing users to update ""start date/time"" and ""end date/time"" could really help in creating a tasks plan. Also ""Lists"" could be renamed to ""Goals""! If the above features are added it would make this app a must have for personal productivity management and goal tracking."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"wow"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good app. simple, clutter free and straight forward user experience."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesnt give notifications for tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice 🙂👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"💕😘💕 it...... love my Google ❤️❤️❤️❤️✌️👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Currently getting too many notifications from this and assistant. Hopefully that stops. I went through all the options, still get some junk that isn't useful + the reminders I set."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Notificações não aparecem sempre"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"color coding would be useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"is average"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"best"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"owsome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple and integrated"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is a simple and useful reminder app. It has all the features you'd need like timed reminders and reoccurrence. Recently a dark theme was added so I have no complaints."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I stopped receiving notifications once I got the app. I deleted it and I'm finally getting my notifications again."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"can we please have more than one notificatiom in the same task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"convenient reminder..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice app! simple yet effective. didnt really need to bring this outside of Google Calendar but the way tasks are organized in Google Tasks is better."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"update my security account NOW"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"sometimes reminders disappear when you have more than one at same time. there should also be a re reminder when you clear notifications and the reminder was not complete. also I lost my remind in so many minutes"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Easy, simple does what it needs to, needs some enhancement and new features , such as sharing or collaboration with other users or contats"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"we should also see the incomplete task too..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Horrible"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Sucks, it doesn't pop up for reminders. Yes I checked the stupid settings in tasks and calender app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"a great app to keep multiple lists going. easy to use and to add to."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"just let go."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"i like its minimal design. Use easily to track things. Good app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"works pretty well and synced nicely across platforms/devices."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"App seems to work as expected."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Effective"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminders appear hours, sometimes even over a day, late."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Worst App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"options to highlight and format"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great to use and definitely a good productivity tool."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"La interfaz de usuario es un poco confusa (iconos)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"add an option to slide between the tasks when opened"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Why is it so hard to provide actually useful sorting options ?? Inverted by date for example - newest on top. Or open the app from the widget. Just really basic things are still missing after all this time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It won't notify you 50% of the times. So not serving the purpose."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Enhance user interface"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I like tasks but 2 improvements would make it 5 stars. A planned list to see a chronological list of tasks with due dates from all lists, and a tablet layout for foldables like the pixel fold and tablets."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Exceptional"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Does the work"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"too complicated reminders was better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"My formerly reliable reminders are now utterly useless. On the rare occasions I get a task notification, it's days & hours late."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I just installed this and yes it works fine but it's missing one thing. Why not a pre alert for your upcoming tasks if I have set something for one? Why not have a pre alarm option for 5 days, 5 hours, 1-hour before. Definitely needed in this app and would make it so much better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"My biggest issue might have to do with the device I'm using or my lack of training because I would prefer to be able to choose an app-specific notification sound for this app. I have a list of reminders and since reminders were removed from the Google Calendar which did have that option it was a helpful feature that I'm unable to incorporate. Also, the app integration with Google Assistant can be unreliable or somewhat of a word jumble puzzle or nonexistent."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Can't even search your tasks or delete a single instance of repeating tasks... So far it seems less fully featured than reminders which they're getting rid of"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Useful but limited in features. Doesn't always sync."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Where are the notifications? Tasks has completely stopped sending push notifications to me, which defeats the purpose. I have double and triple checked phone permission settings, and it's not the phone. Please fix this before I move on to another app. (Reminders worked great...)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"a step back from old reminders. separate app for what should be built in functionality. no snooze action. repeat doesn't work"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Unable to make recurring SubTasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Working and sync with my andriod Google reminder task (make sure you say YES to allow access your account)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"La aplicación no es flexible. Actualmente no permite ver tareas próximas, de mañana, de esta semana, de este mes, etc. La única forma de verlas y editarlas o reprogramarlas es ir a la aplicación de calendario."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I used to love Google reminders because the notifications would pop up all the time. Tasks NEVER REMIND ME! I've updated all notifications and still nothing! Tasks sucks!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"perfect"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I use this program at least daily, and it does every thing it is supposed to,"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"There is no timing option for my tasks nither it reminds me about any task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I hate review grubbing. the app is great otherwise."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's okay,not a lot options,I don't like that new tasks appear at the bottom,and that it doesn't work without WiFi"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"too soon to say a detailed review, i missed a few alerts before. so far simple and efficient task app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"👌 TASK Remeber. Awaiting to include Reminders funtion in Tasks App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"really bad setup. I miss the old one. this one is so hard to navigate it mixes everything up I have the stuff mixed from years ago stuff mix from completed to non-completed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"As u sow, so u reap!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I've been finding this app quite helpful overall. Wondering if Google could add a feature to customize the order of the different lists. That would be a neat feature. Good app for list-making organization!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"want to share lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use alerts reminders and todo all in one place. Love it!!! ❤️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like having the lists sise by side easy to accommodate my random thoughts"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Recurring tasks don't show up until the day they're due. All other tasks are visible into the future, but if you complete the first instance of a recording tasks, it disappears until the due date. This greatly limits the planning utility of this app. I wish Google would fix this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"A Google tasks list... With no search function?!? I had a third party app with a search function! Lack of this feature encourages me to keep looking for another app with some import function."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"may need index to use ap as it builds"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"First of all, I would like to say, I liked it better when it was called Google reminder. The first reason was it looked better. Second and most important, you had no need to change it It looked better as it was. Therefore I don't think I want it so I have to delete it, Until the app improves."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"WWE דב"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"guess the UK to and"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I miss the reminders app. I could snooze if I needed more time and most importantly I GOT MY NOTIFICATIONS! I never get them when they are scheduled. I have confirmed over and over the notifications are turned on and permissions allowed even when app is sleeping. Very frustrating as I rely so much on Google assistant to speak my reminders right when they coming into my head instead of taking the time to open an app and type it. I also set them from my watch when my phone is not on me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Under experience"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Can't trust this app now. Unlike before, most of the time it doesn't remind although all the notifications are turned on. Ask it to set 5 reminders and it will notify only two of those."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminders are not on time. Sometimes app forgets thrm totally!!!! I'm installing Microsoft to do list!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I recently switched from Reminders to Tasks and it has been a complete disarray since then. The UI is weird for recurring tasks, the notifications for tasks never show up on the device on time. I wish I could switch back to using Reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It works well，but cannot connect it with Microsoft to-do is kind of disaster"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple. No fuss 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Not getting notifications of my tasks, which defeats the purpose."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good app, being able to collapse subtasks would be good."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A very simple and easy to use reminder app, its been working very well with my assistant."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Doesn't do much, but good at most basic functions. Would be great to have this do more and be more intuitive. But if you just want a very simple checklist app, this works well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Moo App is it possible to have to go"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"tasks do not send me an notification when due!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Ita not user friendly ,plz conceder it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I'm 4,, Bob v Vance but wbye. Mcb BB BB. Bbbbbb"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"UI is confusing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"can be better if it had a widget"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I enjoy the task setting features, help me stay organized and efficient. Way to go."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"would love to be able to easily copy and paste a bunch of tasks in from a text list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"App has certainly improved, but still lacks a few really needed things. No Wear app is crazy as it would be very useful to see tasks at a glance on my wrist. Also no snooze option seems like it would be a simple addition rather than having to edit the task and change the notification date/time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"couldn't find a way to make the list in alphabetical order"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Can u get all crossed repeating tasks that is set to occur monthly back to some custom time that i need, like for eg the crossed task becomes task again just before 2 days/week before of the day as a reminder to finish it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I want to be able to reschedule tasks from notifications"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Always say cannot reach tasks though not am issue with connectivity"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Repeated tasks not showing until its day of occurrence. very strange."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Really simple to use and I like how it seamlessly integrates with Google calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Uninstall permanently"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I didn't need an app for the daily tasks I already had my assistant listing for me. why does this exist?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Notifications do not work. The different lists of tasks should be able to be ordered."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"absolutely love this. helps me keep track of daily activities."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Absolutely amazing and more"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"sometimes the repetition & time it will remind are hard to synchronize..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works perfectly"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very intuitive"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps me to be less depressed 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"There needs to be a function to set an alarm. I'm putting ""Tasks"" on my Google calendar and completely missing them because there is no alarm to remind me! Tasks is very simple and, quite frankly, useless!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Nicely coupled to Gmail, but as a todo list it's missing some (advanced) features"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I used this app on my Google Pixel to store recipes, grocery lists, what to take with me on trips, etc. One morning I went to check a task and the entire app was empty. It was like I had just downloaded the app and had not started to add tasks. Evidently they don't sync across devices and everything I had entered was gone, and evidently no way to recover it. I no longer use or trust this app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Tasks keep getting silently deleted"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't show reminders most of the times"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy, take your time, smart routine, and so on. Thanks 😊 good bye-bye adios 😇 🥰 good 🌃 night, sweet dreams 😴."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I would like if the reminder notification had a button for snoozing s reminder"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very good google ❤️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent App! Definitely my lifesaver for the day!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Well thought out. Secure. Updated. The best."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Wow someone changed your app again the setting it's always after I set up my app accounts then my phone flickers the my permissions are all off and it's like I am not even signed in"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Tasks app does not display sorting by date very well on this Android app even though it does show sorting by date just find on the Widget. Funny thing is sorting by date is fine in the iOS version, and on the Web."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"after update tasks aren't showing up until after app is opened"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it is a nice tool to help remind you what emails need following up on or if you need to submit more documents"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"There is no widget."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice app for the day to day reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I wish you could label tasks for instance based on importance and it would color them differently on the calendar depending on what label a task has."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"works well enough I guess, and I dont really have time to look for something better. maybe I should prioritize that."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it's OK... as with most of the Google environment/Platform, the integration with Google Calendar, Assistant, Home, ETC. is very messy and slightly unreliable. That is, for me at least it is. sometimes it truly is amazing how assistant and other apps can all work together. Other times, I won't be sure if I added that note to the right list, then it's making a task that just says event. Maybe I just need some training."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Functional, I wish it had repeating hourly or minutes functionality though"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is really helpful to manage my tasks and be productive. I put my ""Honey Do"" list on here."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple and works well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I do like it, keep memory alive"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Pathetic app. All my recurring reminders that I have saved in calender are not giving any notification anymore. Don't know what they achieved by renaming reminders to task and adding one more app to list of Google apps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"location based reminders would make it 5 starts"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very useful app it's synchronizes with your Google calendar! and it's very configurable"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"the best thing is I can do it by ""Ok Google"""
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"don't ask me to review ever again"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Best task app. I need it for my watch!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"App is functional but would be much better if it optionally popped up on home screen, after log in, or other high visibility locale. The pop up and audio alarm should repeat at user defined interval until turned off. These features would bump up its usefulness & associated number of stars but knowing Google it will never happen."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"هلا"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I preferred the reminders vs tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"""Can't reach tasks"""
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"dont ask me to review"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"There should be more sort options Like I add a task but it goes directly top of the list But I want to add this task at the bottom of the list But there Is no option The only possible way to do that is do that manually It's so irritating Whenever I add a task it goes directly top of the list Why Google why You are a big company and doing these types silly mistakes Infact your apps should be more features rich than others"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I would love to use this. It would be so convenient. But it needs natural language support!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"For recurring tasks, after you mark the first occurrence as completed, the next occurrence does not appear until the next due date. This defeats the purpose of having a task list - you want to see what upcoming tasks you have. You don't want to find out about it on the day it is due."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good thing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Finally a way to edit reminders without talking to Google"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"All my tasks managed easily!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Not happy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The integration with the calendar is amazing. what I miss is the option to display tasks from all lists."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I Love Google Tasks!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Reduce No. of clicks to be done for marking task as Completed. I have to tap on each task manually and then mark as completed since multiple tasks collapse into dropdown list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Overall looks good but it's a pain when I use the widget, my tasks keep getting disappear so I have to remove and add the widget again and again. Could you at least give me a refresh button?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I don't really know what's happening, but notifications disappear without me dismissing them or marking them as completed. This happens on my Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, before on my Google Pixel 5 it didn't happen........ No se bien que sucede, pero las notificaciones se desparacen sin que las descarte o las marque como completadas, me pasa en un Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, antes en mi Google Pixel 5 no me sucedia..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"google please stop changing how your apps interact with each another such as google keep and google assistant with google calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"rather dull and dose not interact with calender. no promptscor reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it doesn't have a ringing alarm option"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love it...think of something, just tell Google. Makes life easy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"So much worse compared to google assistant, missing notifications, which is the whole point of it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Literally all I want is to be able to color code tasks in Google Calendar. You used to be able to do that. You can't do it in Calendar, and you can't do it in this app. It's a basic checklist, with optional reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excelente! me ayudas mucho a dar seguimiento a pendientes"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It's regularly not showing me notifications, even though I have them turned on."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"lacking so much I don't know where to start. also integration with Google calendar is horrible now."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not getting task notifications"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"These apps are very good and I have benefited a lot from these apps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Would be really good if you could link it to third part calanded apps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple Easy to Use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Overly minimalistic to the point where it is lacking some features that would be good value adds for quality of life."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Really useful app. Great features!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Big Mistake. Tasks has less features& it was already an option to do task like items in Google calendar. I hate it & I'll have to move to a more useful calendar. I lose the option to have alarms set; I lost the option to put in the address& have a reminder that tells me when to leave the house (THE ONLY THING YOU HAD OVER OTHERS bc your maps is the best and these features were free to use) Why do I need your calendar now? The loss of Integration w/ maps is insurmountable. BigL."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it's handy 2 have"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The web version in the browser should allow time and date. It currently only allows date. Great change so that my Assistant reminders show up in a spot where I can easily edit them. Create a better API and it will be a great application."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Tasks is well integrated with Google calendar and the widget is a big help. There are formatting things I'd like for the widget, but otherwise you can't beat the price."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Pubic Reviews"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The Google Assistant reminders were way easier to manage. Had the ability to snooze and add additional info like reminders etc."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this feature especially because I can add my tasks to my home/start screen. Having this view allows me to stay focused on what I need to get done for the day."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"very mundane and basic, you guys should make it a little fun, no???"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Very lackluster. No control over how the app notifies you about tasks. It's basically a to do list with no real control over the experience. A singular notification is not drawing enough attention."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not for shared tasks not enough customization."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Does a lot with only a little. Not the best, but very practical to keep up with schedule on simple terms."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Fantastic app with awesome integration with Google Home hardware. Would be a 5/5 if it had more features like Microsoft To-Do."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Getting better! If subtasks could list under their parent task in list view(?) that would be great."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It does not always work with my Galaxy 23. So I have been missing reminders I made. Very frustrating."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"tasks is replacing reminders, yet the reminders don't appear more than half the time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Notifications don't work properly. All settings are on for notifications, have uninstalled and reinstalled per instructions. Useless if notifications don't work."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"IT makes my life more easy🤗"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This is very bad feature I want my reminders from keep show again in calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It works"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I would give the 5th star if the ability to group lists was added, similar to Microsofts To-Do app. Aside from that, I'm very happy with this app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Features To Add (Edit) ❌Ability to expand and collapse tasks with subtasks ✅Reoccurrence for tasks with subtasks ✅End on a Specific Date for Reoccurence ✅Ability to put priority flags/stars on tasks to signify importance ❌Create Subtasks for subtasks, collapse and expand them ✅Arrange the order of lists and sublists ✅A to-do note and reminder written on Keep and Calendar should synchronize with the app ❌Toggle on/off of individual notifications for tasks ❌ Fix reoccurrence showing only on due"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"All my tasks arrive in a locked folder now... for some odd reason. It's pretty annoying. I just want them to be in my drop down notifications without a lock on them."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The widget has a huyge amount of empty space."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Tasks has stopped notifying me even though it should according to settings"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"the reminder thing was better then this"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Get ideas from Microsoft To Do like My Day list, subtasks, notes..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"the ability to get from the widget to my list full screen would be useful without having to go in and out of a task. otherwise decent simple app and glad everything now combines"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Just stopped receiving notifications from the app without any reasons, when this is supposed to be one of its primary feature! To help users by notifying and keeping them on track for their tasks! This is really bad and embarrassing for Google!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Tasks for me had to be entered twice and I then deleted one of them! Time for completing the tasks seemed to have changed on it's own choice! First time it's okay, the second time it's different time of the day for completing it! I have different tasks at the same time!(use my inhaler)(take all of my pills), that could be what causes them to change their time! I downloaded the app on my phone and it was sent to my tablet instead of the phone! Definitely not following my intentions for the tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love using this for keeping track of things to do and capturing ideas quickly. great tool!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"My own personal assistant, thank you, Google Tasks.. !!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I no longer get audio reminders. it seems like that ought to be an option in this app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"1. The tasks can not be moved under another task. Can not convert to subtask 3. Can not move task from one list to another. Poor features"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"OMG😊ANYTHING THAT MAKES MY LIFE EASIER TO MANAGE I LOVE IT. I CAN GET USED TO EVERYTHING THAT WILL ORGANIZE LIFES DAILY DOINGS AND PRIORITYIES IS A CHARM AND AINT NO DAY BETTER THAN AN ORGANIZED DULL DAY THAT COMES TOGETHER THE WAY IT AHOULD IF ITS PRIORITIZED PROPERLY"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"ever since I downloaded this app, I'm not getting notifications and reminders. ridiculous."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I'm frustrated that I'm being forced to use Google Tasks for reminders within Google Calendar. Tasks does not fulfill the basic functions that Reminder did, and is a poor replacement. Tasks do not remain visible on the calendar widget once the time set for them passes, rendering them useless as visual cues even an hour past the time given."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent reminder."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"reminders don't pop up as notifications anymore, so they aren't reminders anymore"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"tasks are limited to 30 mins"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I really like this app. It allows me to stay focused and move forward in learning new skills."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Where is the reminder option? This is useless without a reminder"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I miss the previous way of recording and getting reminders from the calender app. I had never had any failures until this recent change. I have to figure out why the reminders occasionally dont work. If its something extremely important, I would not reccomend trusting this app to remind you"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it's pretty productive and good to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Not bad, calendar integration is good but would be even better to implient reminder triggers e.g location and cascades for better project planning"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Finally it's usable. Needs two more option, 1- selecting the first day of week, 2- it should be possible to see which subtask is done for a Parent task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app makes it simple to categorize your tasks. I really like the color color coding, prioritizing, anda highlighting features. I also like that you're able to make so many adjustments to each category and subcategory. This app really helped me figure out how to manage the overwhelming amount of work I needed to do during a really difficult time. Thank you!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I was a fan of Google products. But 'Google Tasks' made me change my mind. There is no dedicated desktop app (e.g. for Windows) or independent browser option. Limited features. Hardly any flexibility. Switched to 'Microsoft To Do' instead."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's been quite handy keeping me organised."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Seems to only notify me of my reminders when I open the app. kinda defeats the point of reminders if I have to remember to open the app to get the notifications. Deleted app and Google caladar took over reminders hope it keeps working."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Tasks should stay on notification bar forever until marked completed like google reminders did. Who gets all their tasks done in one day ❓❓❓ Is there an option to keep tasks there until completed and not wiped off notifications bar after one day ❓❓❓❓ Let people use caleneder as it was and create a bridge to link tasks with old Google calendar events and reminder. One that won't disappear in time. It's worth the work instead of dealing with all complaints and discontinued use of Tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works perfectly without error."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Most useful, simple, clear and easy app for moment to moment use in a day.💯"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's reminders +."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's a way of showing your satisfaction to everyone inquiring on the subject and love to voice my professional opinion to help others . Life falls too short to make too many mistakes."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's rather sad that this app doesn't automatically recognize dates/times in task input"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"LOVED IT. IT MAKES MY DAY MORE PRODUCTIVE"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Infuriating to use, and this app is a buggy disaster. If I set a reminder for 9PM, I should get my notification about it at that time that I set it to, right? Instead I am getting notifications hours or even DAYS late for my tasks, completely defeating the point. Absolutely garbage app that doesn't at all succeed at the one thing it set out to do."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"There are many days when I won't get notifications for my tasks until I manually open this app, which kind of defeats the purpose of having an app to remind myself of things. Is there anything I can do differently to ensure that I get all of my notifications?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Sometimes will give reminders and sometimes will not with the samsung 22+. Very unreliable."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"does what I want but can't share tasks with other people"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I'm starting to see the point in this, however it takes time for me to find the best implementation for this to be useful and helpful in life."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please add natural language to be able to add tasks with date / time reminders. I want to be able to type something like 'put out bins next Tuesday at 5pm' and it knows what I'm saying."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I seriously LOVE this app!! It's so easy to use and to navigate! Thank you for mowing this app I love it!! One thing I wish it had was an alarm for the app since I domt always remember to check notifications but other thst that it's great!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Tasks Do not show up on my Samsung calendar like reminders did. It transferred my reminders, but they not well organized. The organizational structure seems basic, and has no search function."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"my son told me about this app I love it better than using a notebook"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I enjoy that I can just tap on those tasks that I have already completed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"App is missing search option to find tasks or am I missing it somewhere? Please help. Thanks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I started off reading this a five star and then I dropped to three stars last year when one of my lists a scariest deleted and it's not showing up in my completed tasks.. now I'm revising my rating tool one star and will never use this app again :-( I've loved the app, but if I can't rely on it to not delete and disappear on its own I can't use it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"think theres bug going on where unlike before when up to the time of the notification coming through it doesn't notify me via pop up or anything no more 👎."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Widget is great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Terrible. Seems that Google is under the misguided impression that if an app is harder to use, people will like it more. If I want to add a task, I have to save it first and then open it to add a date and time. Waste of my time. I think Google is hiring ex-Microsoft employees who have no idea about anything in the real world."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Just add different colour for different lists other than that it's perfect."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"IT'S GOOOOOD. BUT PLS, MAKE MORE UPDATE MORE OF CUSTOMIZABLE FEATURES!! ESPECIALLY THE WIDGET. LIKE WE CAN ADJUST ITS TRANSPARENY, AND COLOR. THANK U."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Beautiful ❤️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Useful tool which proves itself to be better than google calendar. Recommended for students who like to fast and efficient"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Feature Request. Please add a collaborator feature like the one in Google Keep Notes. So that i can share the list/task with specific person and we can use a shared task list and can edit it as progress. Thank you so much."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Having used Google assistant reminders for years, this switch is literally a step back. I've missed way too many reminders. I literally have to open the app for the reminder to pop up. The thing barely works. Reminders either come in late or not at all."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"At least Add "" Dark mode "" Option..!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good for keeping me on track"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Naggy. Unless you mark a task as completed, it will carry on harassing you about it for hours."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"perfect app to keep one organized:) and accountable for getting things done."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Just started using this again after using Microsoft To-Do for awhile. It works great, but needs a ""Due Today"" or ""Plan My Day"" feature."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Life changing,useful best aap"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"really incredible, free, lightweight and easy to use to app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it would be nice to enter list in bulk. instead of tapping + again and again"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Why can't I move a task to a different list by dragging it there? Or by ANY means? Also, it takes 5 clicks to move each task from one day to another. Select task, select date/time, select new date, done, return to list. How is this supposed to help me maintain tasks quickly and effectively?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminders was a good product. Worked as advertised, easy to use and actually does what it say it does. Why do I have to move to a separate app that does not work as well with half of the feature. If it ain't broken, don't fix it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The app would be even better with 1. Natural language processing 2. Subtasks for reccuring reminders 3. Due date for Subtasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"useing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"making tasks based on a different time zone would be really beneficial"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's ok, but I hate the lack of a location field that links to maps, particularly if you're getting rid of calendar and shifting to tasks like the popups keep saying"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The UI has a bit to go, especially for Google's standards. But I like the layout and the convenience of it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Very Helpful, but what would make it more helpful is if you could put this app on the pixel watch."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"So easy an nice follow well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Would like the ability to turn notifications off/on for each task individually. Assistant asked me if I wanted to merge Tasks and Reminders, and after allowing the merge, I'm getting notifications for everything in Tasks, even if the tasks weren't originally set up with notifications. I'd also like the ability to postpone the notifications for the tasks for longer than a couple of hours."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Recurring tasks often don't show"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Its got its perks but honestly I'd like more intergrated performance between my Goog account(s) and I'd love there to be like a Video tutorial (that's not dry and an hour long) for how to optimise utilising all the apps, tools and software. I also would like to see more markdown availability, I've avoided a number of apps that do a better job for the comfort of ""one account to rule them all"". I have hit a few bumps when it comes to Google products. There is so much room to improve"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"poor customer service, actually none fir most problems."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"perfect app for me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"so cool!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's a very handy little addition to the Google ensemble. Good job and super easy to use, plus it comes with a couple of widgets to make your life even easier.. Nice work Google, only one question... I think it would be even better if Google would give you some theme options (apart from dark mode...) otherwise totally recommend."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"the best app organizer. it helps me with all my busy schedules I don't have to worry about missing appointments."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's a great productivity tool with pretty neat user experience. However, I feel that the functionality of this product overlaps with that of Google Keep wherein we have the checkboxes list feature as well. In my opinion either we make Google Keep as a full-fledged note taking tool with formatting capabilities something similar to Microsoft OneNote, Evernote, Notion etc. or the list festure should be removed from Google Keep. Another way forward which can be thought of is to deprecate Tasks app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It's fine but I'd expect better user interface, it's almost half completed app and left alone."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"can be improved in certain aspects"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I wish this app were more visually pleasing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"For some reason this app isn't compatible with watches. What was Google thinking?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No integration with keep and I'm not understanding. Can you use this with location stuff because I just want to say hey Google, remind me to get my shopping list when I go to BJ's wholesale club a certain location. Why can't we just make this one app? Please Google stop flip-flopping and please make this a seamless integrated things. Apple does this better, but I love open source Android so please help me make this dream come true. Thank you for your time 😁"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I am not getting reminders for some of my tasks and it is causing me to miss these tasks. I'm not sure why it's intermittent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I think this app is very simple, and it also has a good linkage with Google calendar, which is great!But there still seems to be some problems: for example, why can't a task with subtasks be set to repeat? Why can't I change the belonging project if I set a repeating task? If it can be optimized, I believe this app will become even better!😊😘"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It is Mid, it's not bad nor is good. it's simple but I wish it had more presence and options. If it was more like Microsoft's then I think I'd go back to it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"You seem to lime flipping those flops, or should I say vocab"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The app is really helpful. It would be even better if it notifies my tasks at given time. I just can't know them if my screen is off or if I'm not using my phone. Just add any kind of notification."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I need a way for my phone to give me location based tasks again. Eg remind me to water the plants when I get to my parent's house."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"gcash app link"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work half the time. I have to open the app for it to send me reminders which kinda defeats the purpose of a reminder app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like the new arrangement"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Tasks don't automatically update across time zone changes"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Used many other applications but this felt more comfortable and manageable to me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good task manager"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"No way to copy all subtasks in order to email someone, has to be done one at a time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"bloatware"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"A really dumb interface with very few options. Currently, I can't even move tasks from one list to another."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Please add today and tomorrow views to the widget!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"LOVE the usefulness!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's missing the ability to add photos, like Keep used to, otherwise ok app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good on Motorola edge 20 very useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"so easy to use and icon is a nice reminder on home screen"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Seems decent so far, fairly bare bones UI, I'd like it if they could make it that on the ""start page"" (idk what else to call it), you could see multiple lists similar to the folder system for tabs on safari on mac and could move tasks between lists similar to like a kanban board or something."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I find it better to view tasks in this app rather than asking google assistant to show it because it is stable and does not close when I accidentally tap plus adding task/reminder is not a hassle since I can use Assistant to add one. One more I like about this is that it is simplistic and not too cramped looking if what you minimalistic interface rather than cutesy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very handy planner"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Please add a Search function. Instead I have to go into Calendar for this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Why do I need a separate app to manage something that should just be intergraded into Google calendar? Setting tasks on my Google home results in two reminder notifications on my phone. And I'm annoyed that the notification in the tray is collapsed by default so it takes two clicks, one to expand then another to mark complete. If I have to use this app, it would be nice to see the completed tasks for the day in the app like how it was in reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great place to keep your lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Mediocre task manager. Doesn't support default reminders or automatic reminders if a task is missed or not completed on time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excelente"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The best task app by far. Great features."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"essential to my life and for my money, the best 'to do list' app out there"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app for task management."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Intuitive to use, gives info in a manor I can use to be more productive"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"fantastic app to keep me updated with everything I need to do"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Make 🎵 schedule remind me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good but more improvement needed for the completed task you have to keep more interesting so that when the tasks gets completed (dopamine releases) makes as more efficient in our work. Please bring an update."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love this simple app & useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It would be nice if tasks didn't appear in my notification bar 24 hours after the scheduled time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"23w f"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not interested in tasks. I just will use calendar's reminders. Dont force this change."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The entire point of setting reminders is that I actually get reminded of things, and at the time they were set. With Tasks, the notifications of my reminders are consistently late or don't even arrive at all, at least until I open the app. At this point, I might as well just manually open the app every so often to check. The Google Assistant reminders feature worked perfectly and never missed a reminder. Adding needless extra steps to solve non-existing problems is just dumb."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Messy."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Nunca marca como completadas las tareas, no avisa a tiempo, no es fiable y funciona mal"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Literally life changing. I have been power using this app to organize my life and I love it and it's wonderful widget. I have a request though, please let me reorder my lists by long pressing one of them and then moving it. It would greatly improve organization. Also please allow tasks to moved to other lists with a long press and dragging. Slight bug, when holding a task to reorder your list it does not scroll, so you have to move it, scroll, move it, scroll etc. Still love the app thoug"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not receiving a single notification since the app arrival. Horrible Google experience. Missed so many of my important tasks. 😐😡"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Muy buen aplicación. le falta poder compartir las listas. poder colaborar entre usuarios. muy buena"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Not yet good support for RTL text"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"if 2 apps task are installed (eg work and personal) only one will send notification"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"meh. could be better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Notifications disappear without clicking on complete so half the time they do not serve as functional reminders. Surely this is the most critical function and it doesn't work!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I never see nothing that has been tasked no information but they working on stuff but I can't ever see what they have done so I am sitting here with no deposit information???"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good, but could you make it so that I could move tasks between lists?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Its a simple app and its good. Here are some tips to improve it further: 1) An option to rename and delete a list by long-pressing its title. When deleting a list, the app must first ask the user for confirmation before proceeding. 2) Remind users of uncompleted tasks. These can be everyday, every week, every month, every 3 months with one main toggle to turn off all these reminders if the user wants to. 3) Fix the lag when tapping on the title of the first list beside My Tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"little changes take time to become habit"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I'm giving this a shot. I was very excited to find out that there is a better app for task tracking. I'm hoping that you'll be able to share lists soon. Otherwise, this will end up being useless. I'd like to be able to manage Todo lists for kids, household, etc, in one place. I like that it imported my reminders from calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple and to the point. easy to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I gotta say, if you're going to force everyone to switch to Tasks instead of Reminders; you should at least make Tasks a good app. Why can't I set reminders based on a location? Why is there no way to view repeating reminders? Why does the interface feel outdated? It just makes no sense. If they change the app and make it better I'll change my review but for now, it gets 2 stars cause at least it works"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I prefer the Reminders! Tasks are not customizable or custom options are hidden somewhere."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Nope. I can't push my reminders by an hour with a single tap. When I tap ""show me my tasks"" from the assistant I hate that they open like a word document and I can very easily erase or type something over the title of the reminder by mistake. The reminders used to be like events in Calendar, you have to open them to edit them. Not anymore. Major fail Google. Edit: I used to get some notification about a task, now I don't. I just open the app to see a task from 2 days ago I never knew about."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"No ability to set reminder alarms for tasks ahead of due time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Excellent and Easy task enabler, please allow collaborated task assignments through google accounts"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app has saved my rear end so many times! From work to college to prayer and meditation reminders. Bravo!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"You know what... I love Google Tasks. There, I said it. I've tried task app after task app over the years, and EVERY TIME they don't have, or make you pay for, something Google Tasks does for free, so I keep coming back. If Google Tasks had location based reminders that would notify you whenever you went to, for example, any Walmart anywhere, it would be perfect. But that's a feature I've only seen once, on a task app that shut down probably a decade ago. Why does no one else have that?!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"notification isn't coming"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy to use and quick"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Needs more bells and whistles"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Definitely an upgrade over the previous Android reminder functionality. Leaving room in my rating for further development."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The list flexibility is great. Ideas for improvement include the functionality to remove a date selection after it has been assigned, and also a list that shows ""Today's Accomplishments"" aggregated from the various lists.That would provide a great sense of accomplishment at the end of the day to see all that has been checked off!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Seems to be helping me complete tasks ;)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"OnePlus watch not working"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I have a particular task to complete in the early morning hours. This is a time I am sleeping. I set the notification tone to a lour horn, but the default plays instead. This severely limits the usefulness of the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This app is fantastic! The only thing it's missing is location based reminders and family sharing with Google one!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Still prefer Google Keep, needs shared tasks/lists w/ date+time. Also I miss Keep colors..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"jos"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"useful app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Google Tasks is definitely getting better, but it would be so nice if it would be possible to see the tasks as part of each day on Google Calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"📱 💵🎁"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Big improvement"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I hear good things are happening with Google Tasks finally..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Just release on windows 11 as app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"overall ok but cannot share list & cannot duplicate list which are sometimes neeeded from time to time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Google reminders is being killed by Google and has pestered me onto this rubbish. Missing basic abilities such as the 1 hour snooze on tasks or reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Complete failure. Does not function. Consistently fails to notify for daily reminders. Notifications are often late, often by several hours, assuming it brings them up at all. Update: I had assumed that the issues were something to do with my set reminders being daily, or that they were resetting at midnight without my noticing. However, a one time task set for 8 a.m. Sat did not arrive until 11:15 p.m. that night, along with the two daily tasks that I had not been notified of in weeks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google you taking real good care of my online activity and I am appreciate your security and safety matter fact I'm getting 5 stars"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"600GB (<:&:>)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Lacks many capabilities that other better task apps like AnyList offer, like automatic category sorting for things like groceries, making the fact that Google is shutting down assistant integration for third party apps really aggravating."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I just have one question, why is not directly linked with Google Assistant...???...It doesn't recognize it and requires an external patch. This is the bare minimum, it is should be able to recognize it. I enjoy linking my various Google Apps together and coordinating my tasks. So, this was a deal breaker for me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"notification could have occupied more space . and make sound"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Subject wise classification of tasks helps to have control on subjects. The tasks appear on time line of calendar. Very time saving. Day countdown may be introduced adjacent to date."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very easy to use and am loving the email integration. Give it a go!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"better than I had originally realized."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Set a reminder for 5:30 to do dishes. And then nothing ever again or at all. Useless And there's no options so I guess it's working like it's supposed to. I don't know."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Never actually sends me reminders. How is that even possible? Your developers would fail a first year computer science class if they turned this in as a project."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Seems like a lot of reviews are whiny internet people who need some sun. It's does what it says and is helpful for watching all your tasks in one place. Some of yall need to realize the Google Tasks app isn't meant to fix your issues with your parents😐"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This is a very solid task app. I held back a star as it doesn't support place-based notifications, which was in Google Keep and I have to use that also for notifications based on tasks to be done when I get to a particular location. It's not fully featured like Microsoft ToDo, which I use for work tasks, but that app is also missing location based tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Can't create shared task lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"really really basic"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Not helpful for me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Can't share this app with other Google user. That will be good improvement"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"1.Why can't I repeat the tasks that have sub-tasks ? Please add the functionality. 2.Notes within task isn't displayed in reminder notification. 3.I do not wish to see the gamil id under the task's reminder notification. It looks ugly please give an option to disable it. 4. Allow setting groups & tags of tasks, custom colours and icons for tasks that show on notification drawer as well. 5. Fix notification accuracy."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"i wish if the app has like an alarm to remind me of my task .the app is good but can you make some quot or motivational speech when i end a task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Three very important feature that were missing: 1) ability to move the tabs on the top so that I can rearrange the important things to do on the first few pages when I open the app. 2) ability to add tasks to wherever position on the list like Google keep by pointing to where I wanted to add and hit return. 3） Ability to categorize task list just like Google keep."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app can't even perform the basic ability of notifying me when I have a task that needs to be done. I have a task set to notify me daily at 8am, however only received the notification at 1.37pm today. Can't believe google forced us to use this garbage."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Works well but I hate the art style... It feels so corporate and buisnissy... Gross..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Past events that physician uses to look at for example ""remind me in 30 min Albuterol is absorbed at working."" I or my Dr could search for past reminders asthma or Albuterol. Seeing exact times and dates. An option to retain medicine reminders for this function would be nice."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"ITS SUPERB UNIQUE APPLICATION FOR EVERYONE IN DIALY ROUTINE LIFE THANKS TO GOOGLE"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Why would you remove my ability to set things with natural language thru assistant and go backwards with a calendar picker"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good times"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Really. Get rid of reminders and makes tasks the main thing. That's fine and awesome but tasks didn't gain any of the abilities of reminders. Why can I set a task without notification times???? Setting a task that sends a reminder in the morning like oh yeah gotta do that after work. Then another reminder at 5pm after work. A bunch of other new reviews tell exactly what's needed and wanted. Please listen developers."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The best thing it works seamlessly woth Google Calendar enabling you to see all events, tasks and appointments in one place - the calendar. One obvious thing missing is having a Search function in Tasks.. but you can get around it but doing the Search in Google Calendar instead"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"So far so good."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Undo button was covered by an ad to rate the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"day late on notifications"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Task alerts pop up literally hours late (8:30am reminder just went off at 11am, and yesterday my 1:30pm alert didn't show up until almost 6... Been an issue for months, with no fix. Really disappointed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Super easy to use and always keeps me on task!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Horrible App, can't even add Tasks from my Gmail. Crushes all the time, complete wate of time 🚮🚮"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"sangat membantu krn terintegrasi dengan google calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Been using it for a Long time. The best part is synchronisation across apps."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"pretty cool idea. but not sure this needed to be created tbh."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Most powerful sound stereo high HD surround with my choice everything else was in the web group Brave On Myself and safety on."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"need date and time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It just works for me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple and effective to sync across all my devices."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Siri can add a reminder in my exchange tasks. This app cannot even display them."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Vore betydligt bättre om notisar dykt upp."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Utter useless app.... Don't use it for important reminders. If you place a reminder, say for 6:00 AM and you open the connection at 7:00, your pending tasks will never show up, keeping you with missed appointments. Utter nonsense App. Have been using it for quite sometime to make sure of my complaint."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's easy to create and keep track of reminders and it pairs well with Google assistant"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Easy to input tasks and 1 touch task complete."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"reminds me on time, simple and easy to use. definitely recommend!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I'm getting zero reminders for any task. Useless."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and I've encountered no glitches!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Hide stuff it's great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Even after years of existence mobile app is still limited in functionality"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"You delete Google Keep and create Google Tasks instead ? Wrong with you ? You disturb me so so much ! Is it a goal for you to disturb users ? We even can't add picture in the tasks. Disappointing... ."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The app won't link to my account and keeps saying ""can't reach tasks"" I've redownloaded the app and it still gives me problems.. What a bummer.. I was excited to use it.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Unable to delete completed tasks. I am running an updated Pixel 6."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"it will not show the weekly or monthly recurring task for the next occurrence in the list if we have checked it for current occurrence."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love tasks! My go-to daily task organizer."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Useless without customizable sounds!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This App is beautiful and simple. I think it's great. I wish the developers can create a function that allows you toogle the order of each list, kind of how you can toogle the order of each task by long pressing and dragging. I find the app overall very helpful and me friendly"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I would love better collaboating tools for family households. We have to use Chats to assign our sons chores. It'd be great if you just combined the 2 Task formats."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app ready to use"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very gud"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"seems straightforward and slightly more functional layout on task overview and actions"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping track honest its a tornadoe of a program yet life is in so great order. Thank you. Great and Grand Mothers V and Great And Grand Fathers . Best of the best Daughters & Sons .. Love you so much Natures Wild Forest approved"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Please provide an option to move task to different list. Also provide an option to move task list in the Android app as its possible only in Google Calendar web version to re arrange the list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Fantastic. Thanks you"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Very basic, needs improvement but I like using it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No sort by alphabet order"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Assistant Reminders used to come up on my SmartWatch. Now that you tricked me into moving those into this new tasks system, I don't get them on my watch anymore. You crippled the functionality. Please come out with a tasks app for wear OS."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Did the reminders migrations. Lost all my pending reminders and Google keep no longer shows up in calendar. Sucks Used these tools to manage my days and now there all missing. Really poor job with the migration."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I go back and forth with this app. I'm not too fond of the layout and integration with other apps. I wish I could think of a specific example."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love how I am able to send emails to tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"POP PRINCE$$,REVIEW\%"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Give me more control"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Not justifying the purpose of managing tasks. There should be a reminder for task, but the app only sends notifications once in a blue moon, and it doesn't organize tasks into daily schedule, this is something a task manager app should have so I can know the tasks I need to do each day"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Great experience to using this! But just you should the add things as per my uses for getting it more better- 1. Add direct editing option instead of tap and edit the sesntence. 2. There is no Search bar for searching any task in long list. 3. We cannot add any task from middle of the list. Every time need to tap on +icon and it shift to the top. And drag to down. Request you to pls fix it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great for organizing your work and life."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"does not have drag and drop to move items"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very helpful app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Some tasks completely finished some complete."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please add collaborative lists, with invites for other Google task members"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"💓🤠😇"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"tasks failed me again. I set a reminder for 2 then noticed it was 2:40, opened tasks and got bombarded with all the daily tasks I'd set for myself through the day except the task I'd set for 2. I used to be able to dictate a reminder and it's been crucial with ADHD. I'll remember a task while my hands and eyes aren't free then forget it sometimes with critical consequences to my day. I've been dependant on those reminders so this switch from reminders to tasks has been a nightmare for me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"🇲🇲🏴🏳️✅🆚📱📌🔗🆎🔞 i like this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"no search function! how can Google missed something so basic!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"My experions, google task app is very usefull."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Edit. Widget working fine now, thanks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love my Google Assistant!! This is a wonderful way to learn more about how my Assistant works. I'm still learning about everything that my Assistant can do, I'm looking forward to learning much more!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"La amoo"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Thank you for ruining a great reminder. Now it's hot or miss whether I get the reminder or not. I have to open the app just for notifications to come through typically."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I don't like it AT ALLLL. Reoccurring reminders show up months in advance so I can never tell what actually needs to be done today and I can't share it with family. Can't stand Google for removing support for other (and significantly better) apps. It's times like this that I really consider moving back to Apple."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"the app works for me, but I wish it had a reminder and I didn't make marked tasked disappear"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Works well as a basic personal Todo list but not much else. The one feature that could make this a cut above, would be collaboration. You can do it in Google Keep. So why can't I share task lists?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is good app, it lotoff help me, i prefer to it..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best app for different responsibilities"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this is easy to use and you can see them all in one place instead of looking through a calendar month after month"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"App totally good but my 1 suggest is please add alarm ringtone with reminder then it will be more beneficial. Thanks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good job"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Convenient app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This has a Hacker on me. FOIA Right to be informed and Get Justice."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Simple app, simple functionality. Needs to be able to snooze tasks and needs the ability to move tasks between lists."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I really would put a 5 * but I don't have a reminder that says did you check your tasks... lol"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"it could be better, it feels like it's too different integrated apps instead of one, Make it more user friendly"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Barebones. Need more features."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent app but needs a widget!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Don't sell my information"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Indent task and move task between lists disappeared, don't know it caused by 'Move reminder to tasks' or after updated to newer version. Hope Google will add it back. Update on 2023.07.11: Found it caused by repeat schedule added, move list and subtasks won't appear even the repeat schedule is deleted."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"What a downgrade from reminders. No ability to snooze tasks from notification, really the most basic functionality you would expect. Pretty much unusable without that"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"doesn't seem to automatically remind you of anything. you have to check the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Bring back snooze on reminders. Clunky UX, all tasks and all completed tasks are just presented in linear format. Lots of wasted space. Google developers don't use the apps they work on."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Needs reminders function to have an end date of reminders! ☝️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The way this app works with reminders feels like the developers tried to make it hard for the user to get the notifications, and make it difficult to interact with said notifications, if you want to postpone a reminder for let's say an hour, you need to open the app, locate the reminder, open the reminder, select costom reminder date, use the date and time wheel to select 1 hour. This needs a lot of work before it makes sense to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Start of the week when chosing the date it's Sunday, no option to change from Monday by default"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"sinks between computer and phone. very simple app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I like that it is visible in my Google Calendar. I just wish that there is a list for All Tasks combining all list. The only option right now would be the starred list. Also, it would be great to have a start date and due date for a task instead of just a due date. It's doesn't sync with my Samsung Calendar/Reminder apps unlike my other events so Task are only visible in my watch when it has a due date reminder set."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Why isn't this available for Wear OS? The whole point of Tasks/Remiders/To-Do Lists is to remind you to do things and it makes no sense to me why this app isn't on my Pixel Watch. Google should have never changed the way reminders were integrated into the Google Assistant. Google has a problem with fixing things that aren't broken."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Helpful and really easy to use. The problem is sometimes it's to easy to use and I accidently delete tasks that aren't done yet. Some UI updates could be useful in that regard."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Add lists reorder"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"If you had to forcibly replace reminders, atleast add the features to the Tasks app which made reminders usefull in the first place. Why force users to switch to a half baked app? I can't snooze my reminder by an hour which I could earlier with reminders, which is super helpful if I am busy. Now I have to manually open the task and set a new time. If I dimiss the reminder, it doesn't roll over by default in the calender. It's frustrating."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It never reminds me about anything."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"That I can no longer get reminded based on geolocation is a super bummer. Otherwise, the app is very useful."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's really SIMPLE, sobers and clean UI. I had tried multiple T0 DO and Reminder apps multiple time but after installing and using GOOGLE TASK feel good. Excellent TO DO app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"All in all the best there is but needs critical UX improvements. Why can't we add sub tasks to recurring events? And recurring events should repopulate in the order in which they were entered or at least in the order of their reminder times. Some color coding options would be nice."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I wish we could set a default notification sound for the task, now it's silent. It often just pops up in the notification panel, so I don't notice the task. I know it is possible to change it manually, but I use to creat tasks over the google assistent."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"OOGLE"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Oh great, Google got rid of some other product and replaced it with another. Again. Do you guys listen to customer feedback at all, or is the company so big that you're cool with constantly eroding user trust? Anyway, this todo app is functional as a bare-bones tool, but if you want to do things like snooze a task, nope. So if you can't complete a task within a certain time, it will simply disappear from your notifications."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very user friendly"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Ruined, brand new S23 and my notifications are not popping up. I have to go into the app and see what I have for reminders.

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I really like this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app does not allow reordering of task lists or moving tasks from one list to another (tasks can be reordered within the list in which they are created only). Both are major design flaws. This app is also no longer well integrated into Google Calendar, which is a loss of functionality from previous products. I strongly recommend using better productivity apps from other companies."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Undeniably, and simply, the worst to do list app ever designed, now, ever was, and ever will be. Someone or entire teams or decision makers at Google need to be fired for this incredibly worthless app."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Nicely designed, easy to use but completely unreliable. Google Calendar is removing reminders so I was made to switch my reminders to Google Tasks. Fine. Half the time my reminders never pop up, a quarter of the time they pop up ~8 hours late, and the other quarter they are on time. 7/7/23 Today my scheduled 8:00 AM reminder for my morning pills popped up at 7:13 PM.

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"So complex to use. Microsoft app is more simpler and intuitive. Do not download it. It doesn't even remind you unless you spend additional time personalizing it to ring. Don't bother with this. Just get the Microsoft app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"its easy to use and set tasks with google assistant but theyre pointless to set because the app doesnt have an actual notification sound so if im not using my phone the minute the reminser goes off, i dont see it and it gets lost like any other notification."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"As others have said, notifications do not work. It is a pointless tool if it cant notify you to do a task at a specified time."

Unfortunately normal and adult human with mind with responsibility doesn't need such task reminded. These Task R are enablers for convenience, lack of attention, lack of use of brain and in future such type of individuals would always depend on a software direction instead of using own mind and abilities."

I am being forced to turn reminders into tasks and they literally do not remind me at the time they are supposed to. Hoping by downloading the app it will be more streamlined, but based on the reviews I've read I doubt it. Bring back reminders!!"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"How do open a task label for an edit?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The problem? Once you have completed all the task in the list you made, you can Not re-use that list. You must write a new task list. Why is the bad? Because, if you write a 35 items task list for closing a shop at night, then every night you would have a write a new 35 item task list for closing the shop. In other words, you can Not use the same task list over and over again. You must write a whole new task list everytime you want to repeat the task listed. I need a re-usable task list."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I love where we're at with this app but it could be so much better. It needs more customization, organization, and abilities like copying."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I'm so mad at Google right now! Google took away our ""reminders"" & traded it in for ""tasks."" However the one thing that I relied on heavily was the ability to snooze a reminder. So a reminder for a call at 1 pm, I could snooze it to remind me at 2 pm. With tasks all it does is give you the option to complete it. I love being able to just tell Google real quickly to remind me about something, but I need the ability to snooze. Until they fix that for me it's a 1 star because it's useless!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's great that this works with gmail but that advantage is lost because it's too many steps to set up a reminder. It's just as quick to use another app that doesn't integrate. If you create tasks for the reminder feature, Tasks will let you down."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No notification or alert anymore. Give me back reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Very disappointing. Google assistant making us switch over, yet this app does not consistently notify us of daily tasks. More than once I've had to remember to check and open the app, at which point it then notifies me of my tasks for the day."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Great app and love the subtasks! Unfortunately, you can not collaborate with other people like you can on Google Keep Notes and Microsoft To-Do. Enable the sharing feature please!"

Since I updated to Google task, I got notifications on both devices for few days but not getting any notifications on my android phone. Another issue is that I have to clear the notification separately from each device. Very disappointing 😞"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I liked Reminders better. it worked, it was simpler, it didn't require an extra app, the reminders where easier to see and use. Tasks works poorly in comparison."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"please add a way to tag someone with a task!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"So you are rendering this Google nest usless, unless you pay to get reminders. not happy."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"My first day using it to quit my horrible habits and it seems like a great app. An easy interface with no tutorials required, it has advanced features aswell. 👌"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Okay app. Though annoying that I can't delete tasks, one can only check them as completed. Also, can't move a task between lists. Needs some development before I'll consider using this."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"needs color customization. the current them is very boring"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I'm absolutely disappointed by the new tasks.

The integrated reminder feature in calender worked flawlessly. This one is frustrating."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app for reminders, tasks, lists that offers alot of simple but effective options that suit most people needs. I used wunderlist before it was taken down from the store, and this is the first good app that I have found."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works well"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Every Google apps is super"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Love the new features and interface, but notifications are extremely unreliable compared to the old Reminders app. Timed reminders straight up don't show half the time - until you open the app, then you get the notification. This kind of defeats the purpose, for obvious reasons. How Google can stand to put out an app with a such a basic feature this broken is beyond me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love the widget. I can add my tasks and keep checking off it without opening the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"First time using this app!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Something happened to this app and its notifications are not working. Worked fine about a week ago (maybe less) but seems like others are having the same issue. I 100% agree that Reminders was working just fine but I am not surprised that the app was swapped out for something else. I may also just move to Samsung Reminders but do enjoy the Google calendar integration with Tasks - but it is pointless if it's not actually reminding me of anything."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"man love ot"

If you set a repeat, the function of adding sub tasks disappears and vice versa; if you set sub tasks, the ability to set a repeat for the header task disappears. Very frustrating 😤 UPDATE: So I'm pretty much forced to use this due to the integration with Google calendar and me being locked into the Google Eco-system along with the Google pixel phone. Move back to Apple 🍏🤔"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It doesnt solve the problem. the whole point is to remind about the tasks. However, there is just a simple notification. An option to add a sound and Vibration should be available to alert the users."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The app is not well optimized for tablets. The task widget is not as per the size of tablets, it is very small and hard to see, it should have been bigger according to size of the screen. Please fix this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Completely unusable for me. Setting reminders through Google assistant worked great until they pushed this app. The app will not make a sound or vibrate my phone. Notification shows up silently. Moving to samsung reminders indefinitely. Very disappointed about this because ""reminders"" was one of the top reasons why I used google assistant and one of the top reasons why I didn't want an iphone. Yes, i checked battery optimization settings."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Basic but fine"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"App with many missing features"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app has potential as its simple though... The interface isn't able to be customised. Being such a simple app it should have the option for user customisation. Very disappointed user of a Google product. I use Google for everything. I will not be continuing to use this until its updated. Being a company that set benchmarks.

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I found this pretty annoying to use do I uninstalled and installed an alternative."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I think it needs more customization, such as color coding or other means to organize in order of importance. it would be great if, as I add subparts to a general task, the keyboard kept up with the screen scrolling downward. Finally, as a widget, if I'm not careful and touch in the wrong place, it will mark a task as complete."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps me stay focused. I have ADHD and this really helps me to remember the things I need to do."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Just awful. I hate that you can't migrate tasks to a different list if they repeat. I hate that when you create subtasks they show up as their own tasks. I hate that you can't create subtasks on repeating tasks. No snooze feature. No way to automatically view all of today's tasks in one list. All around pitiful. I don't expect the best but jeez Google, get it together."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please learn something from Microsoft todo. Google tasks only plus point is it's integration with Google Calendar. Leaving that aside, this app is way less features rich and looks ugly (no themes and all). Please improve it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Decent app, would be nice to have an option to mark all past uncompleted tasks as completed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"needs better syncing with Google family or groups"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app which allows you to add and delete tasks as you wish to complete them. The everyday tasks are brought forward and one off tasks can be added to any day. From one task you can list requirements needed to complete and whether it can be a DIY task or if we will need professionals for example laying new carpet on hall landing and stairs for which I would need to obtain quotes etc. but can also compare quotes given. Would highly recommend!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Amazing very year 3000"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"ok. basic Google tooling"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Will let others takes test to if see what they come up with your suppose get trouble yeah it's company thing I don't mean to go against anybody region I guess ours is different because since we lost our red marbles in our forehead they got my out the cassette Jewish Indians in Jenny's hips an another I can't remember all of it now"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Theres are no Collapse Subtask, allways expand version. Please add"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great easy to use simple reminder list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Does what I need it to do. No issues so far"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"There's a lot of weird ways that tasks interact. - when sorting a task with subtasks if it is sorted by date then the subtask is separated from the main task, this makes no sense. - If a task has subtasks then you cannot repeat that task. you can only set a date and time, this is very limiting. - can't color code tasks on the calendar. (this would be a nice feature.)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"since getting my new tablet / chromebook this TASKS application has definitely helped me stay organized and especially have a well planned calendar that's in order. -mauhmama"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google is always best. Best apperance and amazing wedget for home screen"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I'm loving it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"it's no longer sending me the reminder. I've missed quite a few ""tasks"" because it's not sending me the notification... so far not happy at all with it. Moved to 1 star. Email address provided is no longer being monitored.. and it's still not sending me notifications for things I've added to tasks. PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE GOOGLE."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app does not pop up or notify me of ANY of my reminders. PLEASE FIX ASAP. ALL SETTINGS are on but still nothing."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Absolute Garbage!!! Had to move over to Tasks from Reminders and I don't get my notifications at all. Deleting and finding a better app that actually works."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it's okay"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No instructions on how to use the app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I need obvious and reliable reminders/notifications for tasks. This does not seem to be offered so it's not useful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Change the reminders back to the way it was, I am not getting notifications. And don't you dare send me a link to an article saying how to turn them on, it's your app that's the problem, not me. One star"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Type the things you want to remember to get done. When done, tap it. It goes below, and reminds you what you've accomplished. And you can delete that list too, if you want. So far, works great."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"As others have been saying you set a reminder and nothing. It never reminds you. Thankfully Bixby is picking up the slack for the stuff that has stopped working lately."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I miss the possibility to share lists with others, hashtags, to see the combination of different lists, f.e. all tasks or something like ""My Day"" from Microsoft, sweep actions"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Useful and works fine. Very basic but if, like me, you just need something simple, it does a good job."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"If notifications don't arrive on time then what's the point?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Lots to like but (unless I'm mistaken) a *big* issue with repeating tasks! *Completed* tasks shouldn't be changed by alterations to subsequent instances - ie. if I amend the title of the NEXT instance of a task the past tasks shouldn't be altered - IMHO"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Panget wlang save"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Since moving to tasks Google doesn't notifying me properly about my tasks. They do not come up on the screen with the option to press ""done"" once they are completed. Instead they just appear in the top right corner very small for one minute and then it goes automatically. Therefore making this app useless unless I'm looking at my phone at that exact moment. Please fix this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"He used to use the Google Assistant for all my tasks, however, now that it's been updated to this app, my reminders are coming in frequently and at the wrong times. Not sure what to do, sadly I might need to switch apps...."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Yes, the reminders notification is enabled! Now please, stop telling me about it every day. Also, I actually really like the idea of a dedicated app, but this one is just sooo barebones."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"दूसरे group में भी भेजे , जिससे इसके बारे में ज्यादा से ज्यादा लोगो तक सूचना पहुँच सके ।।"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Notifications disappear after a reboot or an update, as opposed to the Calendar app. Doesn't even have a ""Search"" feature. Google doesn't listen to its customers feedback"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I was skeptical when Google said they were switching to tasks instead of reminders, and I was right. Reminders had a snooze function, tasks do not. Tasks also seem to have a ""favorite"" option, which I would assume gives it a priority for the repetitive tasks. It doesn't. Overall I'm not impressed in the slightest."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Mast hai 😘"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's going to get me to focus on where and when and how all needs to be, I have many calls and emails, and hopefully meetings to attend regarding my situation of no privacy , so perspective is what this app is giving me, and the seeing what needs done to follow through"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice apk"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not happy Google has forced us to move to this app. None of my reminders converted I to appropriate takes list of course. Thabks for an awful experience Google"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I am obsessed with this app! I have never really been a fan of to do lists, but this app is so convenient to just add any task on the go. I use this app every day without fail and I think it's very good that you can see all the tasks that you have completed. This is the best to do list app and I would really recommend it. 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this helps my natural procrastination due to adhd I think. I gets me to remind myself whereas I couldn't before."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"great but a few things. tighter spacing between lines"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"slightly unintuitive in regards to reordering items. would prefer the widget have a dropdown ""sort by [soonest due]/[starred tasks]"" etc., and maybe even a search bar (that expands when tapped) so I can quickly scan."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple & easy to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"well deserved to use. I appreciate your service dear google."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Omg it gets worse the longer I look at it. - Can't change lists for repeating tasks. If you try to undo the repeating you still can't change the list and it appears as repeating. - Can't see future tasks, just the tasks that are due today or past due. You're expected to see upcoming tasks in the calendar... ----- How long before this app gets the ax? Google seems to be really good at killing things so it's hard to invest into something new."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Not the most user friendly, would be great to have an option to automatically remove completed tasks from calendar."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"/00000, Pppxplpppp BB be xjc Hbppp see do xx. Mis.k kimmi ni xe"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Bland and lacking features"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"This is missing almost all of the features that would make it genuinely helpful. I appreciate that it integrates with Google calendar, but that is it. I only started using these because tasks replaced reminders in Google calendar but it is way less helpful. If my tasks are not completed, I want them to roll over and show on future days until they have been marked as done. There should be options for how and when you want to be reminded."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple & does exactly what I want it to do👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"doesn't include the ""snooze an hour"" notification feature anymore like reminders did. was too easy to accidentally delete or mark complete tasks. unclear if deleting a task that's part of a series if it's for all or just one."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is way better than having to open the Assistant Settings to manually update reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It works well, and does what it's supposed to do."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"sure helps me with my procrastinating self 😭"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Really Nice to Have. Easy to Manage... Thank You!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it's good app but sometimes it's not given notification on notification bar on task time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Cant get tasks to give audible notification for a ""timed"" task?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Super!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Sheets cannot be swapped. Only from PC. By pressing the enter button does not go to a new subtask. You can't collapse subtasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"something great from Google, just praying to Sundar sir, not to take this to their world-famous graveyard."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excelent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Downloaded the app as a replacement for household tasks that we were tracking on shared Google Keep lists but it does not support multiple people contributing to and checking off tasks like in a household. Can do that easily with Keep however. Strange. Not sure the use case here."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it does one thing well. I would love to see a bit more versatility.. lables, repeating at intervals based on when completed, colours, hiding sub tasks. marking as skipped in addition to done. I am trying to adapt it to my personal management system, which is not as easy as I would like."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Horrible replacement for reminders. Randomly pops up my ""tasks"". Useless."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Notifications literally do not work - 95% of the time the notification is supposed to trigger at a certain time, it's just a notification that reminder is moving to tasks, not with the actual content of the reminder/task, and this is ignoring the fact I've already tried to set this up three separate times and it has full notification permissions and no battery restrictions. How hard can this be to implement successfully? It was already done once!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It was very helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"This app should not exist! All the functionally should have been folded into calendars. I can see a need for viewing just your tasks or having separate sets of tasks, but having to go to a separate app just to do so is time consuming. You cannot have separate hide/show task sets on the calendar!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"love it, but wish you could easily rearrange the order of tasks. would give it 5 stars if it had this option"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"i use it often, i like it because i would always lose my written lists, but i dont lose my phone.. often 😂😅"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very good. a perfect and simple daily planner."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I don't like it. It doesn't remind me when it's supposed to. Reminders from the Google Assistant was much better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like it a lot. I treat my tasks list like my agenda planner. Would be nice to: 1. Change the List order. 2. Set repeat option for sub tasks. 3. Color coordinate"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Home screen widget doesn't sort by date. Doesn't allow filtering items that are completed or not yet due. This is ridiculous"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice work"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"wonderful ap pop"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I have NO PROBLEM with Tasks taking care of reminders. What do you need me to do to stop telling me this?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"They do not show up on my phone like before. instead all I get is a message saying Google tasks have been changed to..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it was fine included in 1st app. I mostly prefer it w or under notes. that's actually legit"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"its a good idea, however its falling behind todoist and microsoft todo, lack of dedicated desktop page / app is huge issue"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminders in tasks did not work for me, before it was good. I don't recieve notifications"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Tasks is a great app. I've been using it for over a year. It is easy to use and has almost everything I need to stay organized! and I particularly like the fact that I can use it offline. Overall, I'm very pleased with this app. (^_^)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good and easy to use. However, it does not gave option to see birds view of entire week or month to find out free available slots."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It is possible to make task list. Amazing achievement for Indy company like Google. It is not possible to create task list for your worker from PC or work with your group with a task list. What is this app for? Is it cutted version of Google Keep or what?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helped to keep me on the track 👌"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"what about labels, not able to complete notes. Like reason missed task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"No nested tasks when sorted by date. Sub-tasks are shown in-line. Okay otherwise"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it works to capture tasks and show in calendar. just wish it would move overdue tasks forward and not just show ""1 pending task"""
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"(almost) everything I want out of a to do list app. I love the way everything is designed, but I really hope you add the ability to collaborate on lists with others via the cloud."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So far it works really good. I've not had any problem with it the only thing is that you got. It's very precise. I guess that's a good thing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this app is a good app this app helped me get the things I need to get done done. I like this app because you can app other topic that you want to focus on too. I also love how on this app you can set a particular time to complete it too ."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"An app that's improving."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Garbage, no prompts at scheduled time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"need to improve more .to have option to share in excel format ."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Haven't gotten my reminders in 2 days and I really depend on them! Almost forgot to send in work hours which would have caused my paycheck to be late. Horrible app!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Straight Forward & useful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Thanks for you google"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's nice and convenient, but lacks the ability to share tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Google previously had ""Reminders"" as part of its calendar app, and forcibly replaced them with ""Tasks"". The reminders were much more user friendly, and easier to manipulate e.g. if you needed to edit one reminder in a series without editing the entire series."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"since my task list changes on a daily basis...I love this app because it is easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Please add smartwatch functionality/app download I'd love to be able to check things off via a widget on my watch would make things much more efficient."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Very low number of features compare to other task managers like TickTick, ToDoist, Don't Forget The Milk etc. Should at least be able to tag items so that you can create smart lists like Gmail etc"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"how do I delete a reminder, it just keeps coming back, also my previous reminder all somehow got deleted, UI in this is BS"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The reminder fr assistant can be changed to remind later like 1 hour later. The Google tadk only can choose to mark completed. I'm wondering why using this to replace assistant reminder"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent thanks sort all my tasks with successful done"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"No notification settings mean I am not alerted for a task as I was for reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Really good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Little much at first"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I use this app quite a bit, but I primarily create tasks from within my Google Cal. The option to set a date and time are nice, but I would also like the ability to set a location like I can in my Callander. The ability to sort manually or by date is nice. I don't really use the ""star"" functionality."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ol Ool Loo"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Would like a few more options for organizing and annotation, as well as the ability to hide tasks until their due date or start date, but pretty useful and no major irritations."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Long awaited integration with Google assistant for reminders. I just wish the app has better flexibility in managing long task lists. I would love to see more features to sort and categorize priority of tasks. as well scrolling through up and down long lists and maybe a task search feature to help find tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very Nice Reminder Application"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Most useless App, you'd think it will notify and remind you of the tasks you put down. Don't even bother downloading"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"simple, straight forward. very handy!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good app but it doesn't have any loud ding or timer so it makes it easy to forget to do tasks and I end up where I was before.🙁"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"thank you for this app. can help.me. and update to my opinion. very succesfully.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Tasks NEVER show up on time, often I am reminded 6 or more hours late. Buy hey at least it's updated with the latest material design."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"A very good app. The only thing that disappointed me is that you can't reorder the lists(the lists themselves, not what inside them.). Hope you'll fix this soon. Thanks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It stole my data"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminders have been moved from google assistant to this app. I am not getting any reminders even after turning on the notifications in the settings for this app. Google needs to fix this immediately. What a mess!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Ability to change order of lists on phone would make this 5 stars"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"too limited and not enough options. needs more integrations with other programs EG assistant, IFFT, etc. The latest ""upgrade"" which converted the old reminders into tasks was essentially a feature downgrade"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"can't change reminder sound"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"no notifications"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Why Bother? Everything it does Calendar does better without wiping out Repeating Task when you just want to delete one occurrence."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's an ok app. Would be great if I can color code each task list so when I look at my calendar, I know which task relates to which task list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this app is so useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"only complaint is it is difficult to see up coming recurring tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app have applied me for managing my uni work and personal task. It's really good app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works very well and syncs well with At-a-glance widget."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good connection with the Google account and calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Since I switched to tasks they no longer remind me and I've said all permissions to allow them to"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"You can't search tasks!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Unnecessary app because you have Google Calendar and a couple more that do what this app does and more, so they are more likely the ones I will and have gone to."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"if ur forgotten think u need this one to do clarity what u doin next after that what u doing now 😂"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awasom"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google's ""To Do Lists"""
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I don't like that recurring tasks go into the ""completed"" folder & don't seem to show up again until the due date."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"does what it says on the tin but I have complaints. why isn't there integration with Google assistant if you're forcing reminders to become tasks? why isn't there a snooze? very few customizable options for notifications and how to handle them."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this app is very useful to students"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"5.30am 5.30am g5go 6.30am 🕡"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Could be a little better. The biggest thing I miss and wish it had was the snooze button to delay and remind you again in an hour (would be extra nice if it has an option to vary that snooze the way Do Not Disturb mode in Android asks you for how long)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Needs better sharing and collaboration options, but it's pretty good for personal use with categories, etc"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps me to remember what I forget to do."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great improvement over the old workflow of using reminders (Google Calendar) and lists (Google Shopping List). The two (now outdated) workflows can easily be replaced by Tasks. I like how tasks don't have to have a date/time parameter (i.e. to do lists) but when a date/time parameter is set, it is automatically integrated with Google Calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's running all of my accounts for the same reminders. I'm wondering if they can be all joined together in one, just tasks and reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simply awesome 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It's probably easier to just put your tasks directly into your calendar. I've been using this for a few months and still haven't figured out what the advantages could possibly be. Plus, it's a little wonky to enter your tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Tasks takes your task to task!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Shopping List Experience to be improved. Need a prompt to untick completed tasks when I start entering it again (like in Google Keep). The app is plain and boring."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is aosam"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it's a nice place to put tasks. I'm still using a few different apps though. Callender gets too full of items so I go back to tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Selalu sangat bermanfaat"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"bagus tidak ada iklan"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Please add an option to snooze a task/reminder while the notification arrives. Also when creating a new task please suggest some timing options like (10min, 30min, 1hr) which will be easier for adding timed tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Give attachment option also"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great organizer"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"very useful and helps a lot."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Amazing tool, but it still needs improvement! Desktop experience should be similar to mobile experience. We need to be able to pick and choose which LISTS we want to sync to our calendars rather than it being all or nothing. We need to be able to have repeating tasks WITH subtasks. Think: Routines."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I wish they would buy Tlck Tick. it's a fabulous to-do app and if it could be integrated into Google Assistant it would be really amazing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I really don't see the point of this app being kept around. It's replacing Calendar reminders yet isn't integrated with Google Assistant. Plus you can have lists in Keep so why does Tasks still exist?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it definitely helps me keep my tasks and order and completed. appreciate this app much"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I liked it better before when I had reminders because it had a snooze button snooze"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I like this app okay, but there are a bunch of improvements that would make it way better. the biggest thing is I would like to be able to select multiple tasks and move them to a different list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Setting the tasks up to recur at the same time on certain days has helped me develop better habits during my busy life. 👍🏻"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works well goes right into your calendar!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"even when I turn notifications on there not notifying me. It's kind of difficult to get this thing configured correctly. I have missed some tasks"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I had been very helpful to organize the tasks and remind myself when it needs to be done.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"helpful so far"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"ไม่น่าใช้เลย เพราะดูทุกรายการในหน้าเดียวไม่ได้, งานที่สร้างแล้วจะกำหนด ""เตือนซ้ำ"" ไม่ได้ (ต้องกำหนดตั้งแต่ตอนสร้างเลย ไม่งั้นจะไม่โชว์ฟีเจอร์Recurring reminders) ....1)Can't view all list in same time 2)Recurring reminders must set on new task only 3)subfoler can view on web ... son many confuse"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I don't use Tasks much. If it's not on my calendar, it doesn't get done. I am trying to figure out if I am missing some critical function that would make it more useful for me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"but not working offline"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please allow moving of RECURRING tasks to another list freely?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Edit: stopped working completely. How do you mess up popping up text at certain times in 2023? Not as good as reminders. I get a bunch of reminders from various times all at 1 time. They don't always pop up at the right time so it's pretty useless as a reminder app. I'm going to forget and miss so much stuff now. For instance, my ""take meds at 7am"" popped up at 11am with another reminder."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Barebones, works well. Can't have subtasks AND set it to recurring, only one or the other. Annoying."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I rated this 2 stars but upgraded to 4 stars: Switching to other tasks list became a lot better! Reordering tasks is easy. I used to use gtasks bc of ease of use but Google warned me of Gtasks have not updated for year and may have security risks so I switched. Bad thing with Google tasks is NO SEARCH FUNCTION"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Needs room for improvement quite hard to follow instructions"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"If you are going to force us to use tasks in place of reminders, you need to still provide the functionality of a reminder notification, otherwise it's just pointless. There are plenty of other far more functional ""tasks"" apps out there. This is a HUGE step backwards."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Just started using it. Works well so far."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very helpful and intuitive"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love all Google apps."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent for keeping a schedule and completing tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Favorite"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Life changing app for daily tasks management"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Just okay, missing some essential features. There is no quick snooze or reschedule option when a reminder shows up"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Garbage. Thanks Google for removing basic functionality. My recurring task set to reaccur monthly (credit card bill) wasn't reminding me, then I checked and it says next reminder: 2024. It's broken. It is setting it as a yearly reminder when it's monthly. Please fix this garbage."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Recurring tasks don't reappear in the task list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's very good app to monitor our activities"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"task notifications do not work no matter what I do. reminders was so much better"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"good , could improvise more"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Spetacular"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Awkward . Just can't seem to get it to do much of anything I want. Colornote treats much better How to see lists as full widget or wallpaper without clicking into app?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't remind me anything anymore. It's basically useless. Bring back reminders. Stupid app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"They force you to get this app. Reminders used to work with out the app, they force you to sync reminders to tasks and now reminders don't work at all. Thanks Google."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love you. 💙"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Enjoy this app, but wish there was a way to share tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The only way reminders pop up IIS when I open the app. Horrible user experience. I have notifications on ........."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app has really helped me get s*it done!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Sometimes I don't get notifications for the tasks. Also, there is no way to see completed tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"need more comfortable n simple options"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"needs to be able to assign tasks to people stinks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very nice. missing some small features but it's really nice (and also free and ad free)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"needs 1hpur snooze feature like assistant reminders had"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice agenda"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best ❤️❤️❤️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"doesn't work for me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"there is a lot more to improve but still this app is really good, and I really appreciate all applications from Google. Thank you."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Took out one of best features from reminders of being able to erase one repeating event but not all the future."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Neat and very useful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Hi, Calendar reminder user being forced to switch to tasks here. Tasks do not stay on the Calendar widget. Reminders do. Say you had 10 reminders, and finished 7. The 3 remaining would stay on the Calendar widget until completed. Tasks just disappear, and can only be seen when searched.... I used reminders to remind me. I can forget unfinished tasks on my own. Please let Tasks stay on Calendar widget until finished or add a toggle to."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very good app. But please add date of completion option"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it's simplism caters to me well, however it would be good having the ability to shuffle the lists around without having to delete and remake it all to reorder them. You can do this with the tasks already"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great job"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"App is not starting it's reminder till I open app for the day so it's not working as expected"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"i can't rearrange list in my phone"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"observed this product more intuitive to user, and still can be improved, user interactions at reduced steps. thanks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Thank you ,I need to keep things organized and appointments etc."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's pretty good, but I would really appreciate if I could see on which days I did complete my task, and on which day I couldn't.. (for Daily Tasks)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"like the simplicity but should allow more flexibility, like subtasks of subtasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Before I installed the widget, I was debilitated by simple—however many—errands and tasks. Google Tasks has been a game changer. I just wish it would sync with my Google Home, so that I may immediately add tasks when I'm away from my phone. That is the only reason I am rating 4/5. UPDATE—My wish came true! Lol 5/5!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Google calendar reminders have now been converted to tasks but there is no option of what list to choose from. My medical appointment got saved under birthdays and there is no way to change it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"a must have for time management, becoming task/goal oriented, and just overall organizing and managing your life."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"would love more development and customization. Bard integration would be cool"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very Interesting Google Tasks App Good To Use Here Online ETC."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"the app to manage your day"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"it doesn't work as a notification on my watch like reminders did!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it's ight 👌 could be better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't give notifications even when settings are on. Battery optimization is off as well. Still there's a delay or miss of notifications."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"no notification sounds when I set a time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"really useful for keeping me on track with my to do list!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like this app. It's simple and easy to use. I wish I could have it on my samsung watch though....."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple to use. Extremely useful if you make your own system inside this app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Like tasks better than reminders little more convenient"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it works. I want to start using it for more stuff, but haven't gotten around to it. Sometimes it doesn't send the notification until I open the app, but this rarely happens."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"love the app but can yall add a trash bin for accidental deletion of lists 😭"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"the most friendly app giving utmost output"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and effective"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"amezing tool"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It would be great if we can share lists with others"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Not great. Just have MY TASKS where I can write all my takes. Then add a LABEL system to label each task appropriately. Like in Gmail. Therefore all my tasks appear in one long list in MY TASKS but then I can click on a LABEL to see all tasks with a certain label ie work, holiday, party etc Also hide extra details unless clicked on a task like opening an email."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps to prioritise the work."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google Tasks streamlines task management with visual simplicity, easy scheduling, and seamless task completion marking. You can even activate tasks to appear in Google Calendar or receive mobile pop-up reminders. This efficient system is ideal for individuals with structured routines or extensive task lists. However, one drawback is the inability to share branches and collaborate on task viewing, writing, or completion."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"wenig Funktionen aber gut integrierbar in Kalender"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This is perhaps the worst task app I've ever used. All of my reminders were done through the Google Calendar Reminders but they've deprecated that and moved it to Google Tasks. Tasks makes it almost impossible to find old tasks after they've passed and offers no way to search for Tasks. The sorting options are awful too."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"More features would be helpful: Having the ability to see my tasks crossed off rather than disappear. (So I can feel like I've accomplished something.) Having the ability to recover tasks (for longer; at least) after checking or deleting. (In case I accidentally tap one and can't remember what was written down.) Ability to add photos or screenshots. (In case I come across the best conceived method of accomplishing the task in a list.) Etc. I know it's like notes... but I use notes differently."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Previously I use ""Todoist: to-do list & planner"" from Doist Inc. That app is far more better than ""Google Tasks"""
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good stuff"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"What can't I share my Task lists with Keep !?? Having only complete & delete options is very restrictive. Much could be done, to integrate Keep, Tasks, Gmail, Calender. Pls improve the currently very poor widget, very important for a Task/Time Management app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"SUPERB"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"बेहतरीन"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Ideal for a retiree, like myself. Once you learn to add new tasks ie: payments, medicines, & leaving home for appointments etc. You can remove ticked off tasks, contrary to other people's opinions. You just tap one of the symbols @ the bottom of the page, with appropriate words & they're gone."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Can seem to had an alarm or location like on a reminder so basically useless and need to find an alternative"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Peak"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful i dont forget anything anymore changed my life"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"There's no reason why this is separate from the assistant or the keep app. It's just more garbage I gotta install"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A great way to keep up with your to-do list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"buggy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Fairly basic. I like that it integrates with Calendar but I don't like the calendar view in Tasks - my week starts on a Sunday so it would be nice to have the option to customise. The app takes getting used to and one has to remember to switch between grouped tasks to see them all. And those with no date fall to the bottom so another ""group"" is required to manage them or they never happen. Look forward to more usability in future"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Garbage. I miss Google assistant. It knew when I changed time zones and I had the option to snooze tasks for an hour. This is completely awful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Bring back reminders. This is a horribly thought out transition and I despise the assistant integration of the tasks app vs the old reminders. I spend so much more time fiddling with this app to organize my tasks (which are just reminders!!) into anything usable than setting the old simple voice and calendar reminders. Most of the time I miss them now so it's basically useless. Tasks and reminders are two different things. Google seems to be bent on redefining this at the cost my productivity."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No notification of reminder, no matter what settings I change. It's a shame because I love having all of my apps synced to google"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I think it's really good info"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"could be a little easier to use but it's free"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Why are the changes I make to my lists deleted???"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Not enough customization options, but overall it's a solid to-do list. It's much better than others I have tried and the integration with Google Calendar is also extremely useful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"DO NOT SWITCH YOUR REMINDERS TO TASKS! No matter what I do tasks will not notify me of any reminders created with ""Hey Google."" This was a horribly integrated migration. Now I can't have reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I want to like and use GTasks, but until they include a ""repeat after completion date"" option, it's useless to me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"definitely an improvement"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very handy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good 💯😊"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this app really helps my job lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Not happy with this as the alternative to having reminders on my calendar. What's particularly annoying is repeating tasks disappear when you hit completed, instead of showing the next day in the sequence."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"a bit confusing, not a very intuitive interface , overall a decent app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Larry wolff has to get a Link 🔗"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It's suprising that Google has decided to roll out this app despite so many shortcomings. (1) Search 🔍 - X (2) Date 📅 time ⏰ recognition - X (3) Printing list of tasks - X (4) Image / PDF upload - X Overall experience - 1/5"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"No location based reminders = Boy bye. Uninstalled. (extra star for decent interface)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Never installed this app and had google assistant disabled. Assistant still managed to open itself while my phone was off. Then opened this program and granted it access to make changes to my calender. Then setup a reminder to take out the garbage. Guess they think that will make me use their garbage bloatware. I've uninstalled/disabled as many google apps as I can and it's made a huge difference in the speed of my phone. It's like new again. Even reduced my ping in games."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome app to help you keep track of your daily tasks! God bless ya and take care"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"As far as I can tell, the reason for installing Tasks is to organize your lists. However, this is hamstringed by being unable to move certain tasks (repeating tasks). If you use repeating tasks I really don't see a reason to install this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"the alerts to tell you to the task are not very alerting"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"really usefully, love the widget. do wish there was a way to reorder the lists on my phone, and it keeps reordering my tasks when I need them to be in a specific order as well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So far optimistic"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Any chance we will ever see Google Tasks for Pixel Watch?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Originally the tasks or reminders would all come up as notifications set into one and you just click and you could see them all! Now RECENTLY for whatever reason they all come SEPARATELY as notifications on your phone! That means if you have 20 reminders that day then you have 20 separate notifications popping up on the pull-down menu on your phone.....that's RIDICULOUS and very irritating. Why wouldn't you have all the notifications set into one that you just click on and the rest are shown!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's ok but very basic. If you are going to take reminders out of the assistant app don't remove functionality. I really miss the ""delay 1 hour"" option in the notification. It would be ace to be able to customise this delay time too. Functionality to have family tasks would be great, where everyone in the family group gets reminded and any of these people can mark it as done. Or just a collaboration feature like Google Keep."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Enjoying this a lot so far, especially over the way that reminders used to be handled in the calendar. One suggestion (especially useful for sorting) would be the ability to apply the date/time stamp for a main task to all subtasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Moved from using Reminders with Google Assistant to this is a step down. Seriously no option to snooze a reminder? Before I could snooze the notification for an hour. Why tell users to ""upgrade"" when even basic features are missing."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please google....i have only one special request. Please can we have a custom notification sound for this app only, so that when a reminder sounds, we can tell it's not just a text message I will give 5 stars for that."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Brilliant app - but avoid it if you have Google Home devices. Was very happy using tasks, until it's totally taken over all my Google home devices - I can't do anything on my Home display without it interrupting to tell me about a task. Sensitive reminders, like birthday gift purchasing, also appear across the display for everyone to see. Such a let down for such a good and well integrated app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"still getting used to it. So will communicate later"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Thank you so much."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The Best task planner👌👌👌"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Notifications from Tasks vanish when we clear all notifications unlike the Assistant notification that stayed in in the panel"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Awful! Google forces this over the reminder app but notifications don't work no matter how much permission you give it. Such a rubbish software engineering! They roast you in job interviews but this is how they develop software. Disappointing."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great. Can you add transparent widget?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The app logo is alnost identical to Bixby Routines on my Samsung device, which means the notification logos on the notification center are quite confusing.... Other than that the app is decent but feels kind of unpolished for now. I do like the integration with google assistant, so I will keep using it for now."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Can't even inline create nor edit a task. Most task apps have an 'empty task' below the list to quickly tap,type,& new-line to add a new task item. Not this app. You have to tap a button which opens a different screen, then hit another button to save. When you tap to edit, different screen pops up (instead of simple inline text editing). UNintuitive to task lists in real life. Convenient side-swiping to view other lists. Sort options. Direct integration with Calendar. But LACKS basic features"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Needs snooze functionality for reminder notifications. Also needs cleaner / compact view options to see list of tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"best app to manage task but really awesome."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps me with my sceduale"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"super easy to use and very helpful to stay organized"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Mostly useless appendage in the Google ecosystem."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"perfection 🔥"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"so far so good."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Tasks app doesn't remind you. You have to go to the app every time which is inconvenient."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The whole point of a reminder is to be clearly and noticeably reminded. However, it gives no options whatsoever to change the sound, tone, volume level, or anything to help notify me & remind me of the task I have set! I have no idea why this app exists if I can't adjust the sounds & tones to where it suits me! Reminders used to work great! But so far, since my reminders have all moved to tasks? I havent heard a single notification for anything I've scheduled! Not helpful at all! SO FRUSTRATED!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Beeeeeeest!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Tasks helps me to get things done."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I have to put things on a website because I get so busy to I need things to remind me and I am glad I discover this app Thanks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"can't delete tasks without completing a task or rename. also doesn't offer a color variety so you can highlight some tasks over others. it does have a starred system but for me it's not enough. otherwise, it's easy and simple to understand and use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"OK"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Dosent sync my tasks from Google assistant and has no settings option, can't customize anything. Why would I want an app to keep track of my Google tasks if it can't even do that.. What is this app even for exactly??"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app is not reliable. All notifications and reminders don't show up on time. I can't even go back to regular Google reminder. Add option to go back to regular Google voice reminder."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I really would like if it were possible to choose which lists would show in Google Calendar. Right now, it's all-or-nothing, which isn't very helpful if I want to have a list with daily reminders. So instead I'm stuck using Reminders in Google Keep for those, but that app has its own set of issues, especially with the notifications. I'd rather use Google Tasks for all of it, but the calendar becomes useless if you can't choose which lists to show."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's a useful app but it needs an improved design. Google is already working on improving it and I'm sure with a few tweaks it will be five stars."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It never showed the remainders properly."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works perfectly"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this app it's keeping super organized and helps me prioritize what I need to every day week and month. I totally suggest getting this app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"not so pleasing to the eye. please make it look like Google Kwwpy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No location-based reminders anymore! So Google convinced me to move my reminders to tasks and now I can't get location based alarms, and my old ones were turned into a note in the task. Lowering the usefulness of an app, way to go Google!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great New Google Feature. Reminders have always been rather clunky in the past. With this they are getting better."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"need good sorting options it's must"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's very helpful. Thank u for this app!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Hardest thing is develop the discipline to routinely use it! But a good productivity aid if you can use to focus your daily activities."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Thanks to all"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"ad more features"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very good. Could be better. Why not enable task sharing with a family group?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Treated me well through many iterations all these years. Like the Gmail integration. Glad to see the relatively recent Android 2 headed Cerberus being consolidated down into just one."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good but I wish there was an option to create reminders for each task the way I could do with the calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Sub Task Features not available when creating repeating task! Why do Google put in these stupid restrictions when every other Todo App works intuitively according to what the users actually wants to do. Why can't Google integrate things properly? There should be integration with tasks in the mobile version of Gmail. Also why can't you set a reminder in Google Keep that appears in the calendar?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Missing many features. UI is clean as similar to all google apps, but you still can't search for a task not can you share a lost which for me was a deal breaker. Also there is no option to import lists from other apps. I'm using To Do which was bought by Microsoft few years ago. Still the best Todo list IMO"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"better tasks and reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"productivity improves"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It's great that tasks are now centralized in one place. But why in god's name is it asking me to turn on Task notifications everytime I have a task. I already turned the notifications on. Is this a bug or should I uninstall the app completely?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"great across all my devices"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A good competitor to Microsoft To-Dos. As I utilize the Google system more I'm realizing it is more integrated than Microsoft and more practical."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Total garbage. I can't even change a task's list. Lot of bugs. 🪲"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love that you can do different lists for anything."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Very happy with the services"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Tasks app is acceptable for reminders. I like the ability to add notes, which I couldn't do with Google calendar reminders. However, on a day with a lot of tasks it is visually overwhelming. It would be lovely if completed tasks were collapsed into a single group for the day that I could click on if I was curious about something."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Force back because of reminders merger 😓 Old: Still a little bare bone. Can't reorder the menu of lists. Need a way to quickly add multiple items. Back button should take you to the list of lists, not exit the app. No search. Notifications after every edit when one is due. Does the dev team not use this app? Does this not get any work at all?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Can we please get a 1-hr snooze feature through the pop-up like we had with reminders in assistant?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Perfect choice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Tasks is very helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"there is no setting for this to do an actual alarm it just shows up on screen that's it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"No sirve para tomar medicamento ya que no se puede configurar un recordatorio cada x horas"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's a simple app, but it keeps me focused. Just what I needed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Please include these values to delay the reminder/task to its notification: 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 1 hour, 2 hours. It seems your having users migrate from reminders through Assistant to Google Tasks, but the delaying ability is crucial to how I use these reminders/tasks. Snoozing the notification works fine on the phone, but that option doesn't exist on Wear OS. Thanks in advance!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like it better than reminder"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"can't delete a task you no longer have to do, unless you mark it as done. cancel doesn't work"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Godawful experience, Google bullied me into switching my Reminders onto this app and it's been nothing but issues. Wish I could switch them back. Google Assistant handles them MUCH better."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I wish the 1 hour snooze feature wasn't removed. New app less functionality"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"mantap markotop"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Ihave been getting no notifications since I've downloaded this and switched from Google calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app for tracking your to-do lists."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Simple and straightforward, but I was hoping for voice assistant capability so I can bark out thoughts as I'm busy so I don't forget. Would also be nice if Google Tasks was an app I can just download on PC instead of being a weird side addition to random google pages."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Plz add option to show all tasks present in all lists in widget so that we do not have to switch different list to see upcoming reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Was working when I was using opengapps instead of google play services. After I switched to microg (a different implementation of google services), it stopped. The app cannot detect my google accounts even though other google apps see them well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Tasks has improved over the years that I have been using it. I thought Keep was going to take over and replace it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"not getting any reminders for tasks with time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"pretty useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"wish I can send these tasks to someone else."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"These people want you to be there house maids so they can throw You A old bag of clothes and pay you less than minimum wage white slavery of Christian coalition Mr Bill Gates."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"user interface needs to be improved."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"cool"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"For the widget: Bland white background without visual options. Only my daily tasks properly repopulate. The weekly ones didn't and I'm not keeping it long enough to find out about the monthly ones. I might check it out later if it every gets fixed, but by then I'll likely be in love with something else."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I wish you could set it up to automatically delete completed tasks after a certain time limit, i.e. 3 months"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"leave me alone."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Actually kinda useless. Doesn't consistently notify me of my tasks/reminders unless I open the app, thus defeating the point of having it in the first place. Not only that, upon uninstalling it there's no way to get back into the old reminders feature built into google assistant."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Real life tasks especially big tasks require more than a few lists with tasks and one level of sub task Some require to be broken down into a number of subtasks with subtasks so this limit should be removed Also the interface could be improved by being able to pin the list of lists on the side. Tasks and sub tasks should be movable to other lists or new lists. This is a very limited version of a far superior task app that was blocked by Google a few years ago and I've seen nothing better since"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful, the bes user interface I have ever used."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Add a feature for partial completed tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"A great way to organize your day. Visually seeing your tasks both on your calendar and on a tasks menu helps you see and prioritize each item. In the words of Stephen Covey, you get to conquer the ""Big Rocks"" first."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"would be more useful if I knew who's computer this is connected to"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"From great so far to horrible."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app used to be great! For some reason it'll randomly delete all of the details listed under random tasks. VERY FRUSTRATING"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I am not getting any notifications of my tasks and remainders. Everything sucks here....."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Definitely not as good as Apple's Reminders app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works well"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent reminder, keeps one on track!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I like how it syncs with Google calendar, but it's frustrating to use, if you are writing multiple tasks. I hate having to pop the keyboard up every time, I wish I could write mulitiple without the keyboard going down. Especially subtasks. The repeat option is amazing, and it would a cool feature if it could repeat based on task completion instead of task reminders. -1 star bc the email is wrong"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Persistent notifications should be an option"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I like how easy it integrates with Google Assistant. And I like having the widget option to put on my home screen. However, I would really like all of the Google widgets to have better color and size customizablity. Most non-google widgets are able to be shrunk down smaller and more color options, especially seethru/clear backgrounds. Makes the home screen look less cluttered without sacrificing usability of the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"To do apps are there to lower our Brain cluttering. Why do you show us tasks from Monday on Saturday when I have clearly specified the tasks to be scheduled between (Monday- Friday)? I want my todo list to be clean so that I can have a sense of accomplishment, Not keep seeing tasks that I have to do 2 days in the future and get overwhelmed by it!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"What happened to sub tasks. I am not able to create them anymore. 😥"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it! Simple and much better to use than Keep Notes. I keep a daily task list and reference it throughout the day."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good task manager. I wish it were a bit more integrated with the Google ecosystem, with the possibility to link places from Maps, photos for reference, and documents from Docs/Sheets/Slides. This would make tasks more functional, thanks to the additional context information (e.g. where to go)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Used to work great now most of the time the notifications don't work and the way I set up daily reminders is no longer available. They should have left the reminders alone!!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Kuchh Nahin"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Task notifications fail to pop-up until the app is opened. Really glad i moved my reminders over 🙄"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Give me back the snooze button"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"App leaves much to be desired. For some reason subtasks are moved to completed tasks instead of remaining under the parent task until the parent is completed. This makes keeping track of subtasks unnecessarily difficult. Microsoft's To-Do has better overall functionality, it's just a shame it can't sync it to Gmail and Google Calendar like Tasks can."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I needed to organize all the clutter in my head."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy-to-use and user friendly"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"First thing it did after importing all my reminders like it was supposed to was adjust everything by an hour so I had to go back and redo everything."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Gere against my will from the death of reminders. The conversion broke all my recurring reminders. Can't delete single occurance anymore. Have to delete all past and future."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I honestly really prefer the way the assistant handled reminders previously, if it really needs to go into an app it should go into keep notes"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Basic. Leaves a lot to be desired."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Seemed promising, but when you create a repeating task that happens more than 1x / week, the ""next due date"" is not calculated correctly. Setting up a task for Tuesday/Friday each week and then marking the task as complete on Tuesday, makes the app show that the next time it's due is Tuesday. Marking it complete on Wed-Frid shows the next due date as the following week Friday. Seems like a simple enough algorithm to code. Quite disappointing."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Seems to be good so far will use longer and update review"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The loss of reminders SUCKS! I used that more than I did tasks because I could get notified at a specific time to do something, like ""stop after work & pick up new Rx"". Tasks only is b.s.! Add a notification feature."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I am NOT a fan of the move from Reminders to Tasks. I can no longer Snooze a task for an hour and have it remind me again. I used this feature in Reminders quit frequently. 😡"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I now get reminded 3 times for something I only set up once. Probably because Google keeps moving this feature around."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Google Tasks, Google Keep, Google Reminders. Too much apps. Integrate all into-one single app with note taking and can be even a starter competitor for one-note, tasker or even notion"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Love this app! Please allow us to move lists (rearrange ) and then it will be Alpha! 👍🏻 Down the road, shared, multi user tasks of course. :)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It would be fantastic if I could re-order my lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Why did they migrate from assistant to Tasks? As others have pointed out, it should be much better at what it does considering how little is in scope for this simple app. Can't seem to just list my recurring reminders. I don't have confidence that my reminders will be delivered. For example, should I mark recurring reminders as complete, or will that cancel them? Actually impressive to make such a confusing app that does so little."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Are you serious! I migrated my reminders over to task and they are not there! I hope they still remain in Google calendar!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I need geo-location triggered reminders. Cant set a time if dont know the time i will be back home. I need a reminder to do stuff WHEN i get home, or 10 min after i get home...."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"They got rid of my snooze for my daily task reminders. Terrible execution. No idea why people stay employed when they make things worse."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Please bring back reminders it worked across all my devices. Since moving to tasks my nest hub does not announce my tasks anymore and as I use it as a tablet reminders this is terrible. Tasks is just the poor man's version of reminders. Please fix or bring back reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"To bad to see your forcing useage of tasks. It's clearly an inferior app when compared to what you should've expanded - KEEPS. Now you migrating reminders to tasks. Tasks is a poorly executed app. Every list in tasks is the same. For each list! At least in KEEPS you can have a few different colors. Listen to your customers for ONCE!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Having issues EVERY TIME I try to add an app listed as FREE with G/P Membership *Tried all G/P suggestions* Frustrating %$#@"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"good feature to add is to have a snooze so the reminder will go off again at a later time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very useful app especially after its integrated with Google calendar. Only things that I don't like about this app are no option to notification or alerts for a task or reminder. It will be a nice feature if it send u an alert a day before so you don't forget. And other thing that is missing is ALL task/ reminder list. There are section/ list and Starred list. What missing is a list which show every task or reminder from all the available lists at one single place."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's really good experience over here this is a really helpful app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"please ask to confirm delete list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"works as described but missing an option to enter tasks by voice."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I really need to be able to rearrange the lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The app is working pretty well so far but it's missing Snooze option. Reminders via Google Assistant gave the option to mark the task complete or snooze for an hour. It'd be great to have the snooze option back."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Good app, it works ok with calendar on phone and browser but there are some annoying issues If task reminders set for the same time on the same day they don't nest like the old reminders used to. There is no Wear OS app so can not see tasks on my Samsung watch. Reminders don't show in the calendar on the watch. So i have to keep reaching for my phone.. Please sort this out Google."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is a much needed app/feature to make reminders more robust. I've been waiting for this for a while now👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I loved reminders this is stupid backwards and a big mistake $ 1400 for a phone that no longer reminds u nor fingerprint stopped working plus facial. I hate tasks. I won't be buying another this is my 2nd"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Perfect for a brain dump to organize later!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Google as a whole basically has become more inconvenient than convenient this app originally begin as a quick convenient way to communicate with your email photos social networks it has now become not only annoying with the interruptions now they want you to pay every couple of minutes and I'm saying that real clear minutes the hindrance as a disabled person is heartbreaking various ways"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple & Efficient."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The app is easy and obviously well integrated with Google assistant with plz give the option to snooze the reminder"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Does its job but it'd be great to be able to set more than one notification for a task e.g. send an email a day before and send a notification 10 minutes before. Similarly how it was possible in the calendar app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good Evening 👋 I'm Just Asking ""If"" This App is going To Replace Google Keep Notes? ... Because You Automatically Got into iT but I'll Hit You With That Paperwork Now Thank You So Much, Best Regards Emma Luz Brizuela at Your Service... 😆😁👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"There doesn't seem to be a way to get notification reminders the way Google assistant was able to. I hate this change. It has been nothing but a downgrade from the way reminders used to work. I will be very happy if they revert this change back to allowing google assistant to give notification reminders once more."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Why? Did someone's brother need a job at Google? There is nothing wrong with Reminders. They work perfectly. I liked having the ability to bump them back and hour. Now all I can do is select ""Mark as Done"". If I wanted to changed the day or time of the reminder it was easy. Now it's very challenging. I've uninstalled it. Please don't take reminders away."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"super convienant"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app. love it. muwahhh"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Switching to tasks has ruined my ability to set reminders with the Google assistant! They don't show up anymore on time"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"exactly what I needed, but I would also like to be able to view all tasks for next month in a sort of grid that is better for orientation"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"superb"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"If only there was a standalone desktop version... Not the Gmail or Calendar integration!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great job"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Not bad, but a little too simple for my taste. Still, having a basic checklist is nice."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Excelente app, lo mejor es la integración con workspace de Google. Mejoraría el Widget con fondo transparente. Y le haría falta integración con wear os"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"so glad reminders and task are the same now"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"not as good as reminders in my opinion but I guess if they are changing to this I have no choice but to use it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Nice Application..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I miss reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I don't get the notification for my reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Why can't we rearrange the order of subtasks inside the main task page? Also, a desktop version will be much appreciated!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"After migration of google reminders to google task, i have so many issues. 1st is when i was getting reminders notificatios from google assistant, it gave an option to increase the time 1 more hr but google task is not giving such option. Google ruined reminders. Also mark completed texts are look way too big and ugly. Add remind after 1 hr feature button back. After reoccuring reminders aren't working. 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Decent but needs work. Allow us to make the widget transparent! It looks awful otherwise. Also put the snooze button back for reminders!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"haven't had much time , felt a bit forced on me but seems pretty good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"brilliant!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The widget doesn't get updated even after days of updating tasks. Sub tasks are shown and main tasks in the app with no due date There's no option to add repeating tasks in the app, but from the widget we can add repeating tasks All these are major mistakes/bugs that have to be worked upon If these are corrected then the app would be much better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Don't migrate your assistant reminders. Even once you allow notifications as they become Tasks... You don't get notified. It just shows up on your calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works great with Google Assistant !"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Bring back location based reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Loved it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Needs snooze functionality."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Fantastic. Only thing I would like is the ability to drag and drop the items within a list when priorities change. But the fact that it is in my calendar and also shows up on my watch is so helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I had reminders and it was working just fine, then Google force me 2 convert to Google Tasks and I've had nothing the trouble ever since. This app reminds me late half the time, and the other half of the time it doesn't remind me at all. I have missed important reminders including a meeting with a high value client, so in less than a week of having this app it has literally cost me a sale. It's absolute garbage, I just want reminders back."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"There is no snooze option. Forced to shift to this from calendar, and there no snooze option. Why do you have to be so dumb google?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The widget should have options to customize the transparency, color, text density and more. This is a major lack."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Have been enjoying this app since I accidently found it. 🤨 And it took a little time to figure out All that it can do, but for the most part, its fairly user-friendly, I've had to play around with the 'repeats and times', but you'll get the hang of it pretty quickly. The Plus is I don't get any ads, which is Awesome! I really do Love it ❤️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I liked reminders. tasks stick on the calendar day. reminders got summarized on the day"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I would like to see on this task able to choose colors for your task Also, I would like to see a snooze button on here"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please allow ""1 hour later"" option when reminders come up.. This is a godsend for neurodivergent ppl such as myself. I need to do the task but sometimes I don't wanna do it right then, so instead of having to go into the task to move the time an hr every time, using what the Google reminders did for the ""1 hr later"" option after the notif pops up would be extremely helpful and would allow me to add more stars to this review. Pls consider your neurodivergent users. Thank you!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Needs transparent widget option. A Widget option for ""Today only"". An option for ""No Date"" tasks to display at top of list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"No snooze button on task notification 😭"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"ad-b GitHub co-pilot--RCS--yield"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Losing the ability to use the snooze option for a reminder is the worst they would have done for this. I will no longer use Google as reminder function without the snooze option. Extremely disappointed they've made thus switch."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great tool"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I use this tool regularly..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"no ability to search from a company that's built its foundation on search??!🤤"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, integrates nicely with calendar. Great in combi with web version in chrome."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Satisfying"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good experience but, task does not repeat if ithas sub tasks and sub tasks don't repeat themselves. Please add this option."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Wow... Google really bungled this Nest Hub migration from reminders to tasks. Terrible work folks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"No way that I found to control the alarm type or length of ring or have snooze or anything else. I'm looking for a way to have alarms set for Google calendar events, not just email or text notifications but actual alarms I was hopeful about this..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"meh? does the same job as Notes yet less intuitive. Why bother?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Its definitely less buggy than Google (official Search app) is for managing reminders. The issue i had with editing a reminder is gone. It just works as intended now!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I am a power user of the old Reminders and I absolutely love this app. The only con is that it's not possible to set the calendar's first day of the week. My Google Calendar starts on Monday but here it's set to start on Sunday. Would it be possible to sync with the Google calendar setup?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No sync with calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Still could use more features, especially tags and a better way to attach documents similar to how it does emails. it does this if you're a workspace subscriber beyond the individual level but it would be way better if everyone could do this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I have been using the Google assistant reminders feature for a long time. Unfortunately I migrated those reminders to Google tasks. It feels like a downgrade. It was worked fine for a day and now its no longer showing notification or reminding me about my tasks. This is very frustrating as I have been depending on reminders for a lot of things. Also the old reminders app had a button in banner notification to push reminder to another hour, which is missing in this app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Im am quite forgetful so have found the google reminders very helpfull in the past. So i was delighted when there was a dedicated app. BUT I preferential looking at my reminders/tasks via Google, as the app quite useless atm. There needs to be an option to view all up coming tasks, all I can currently see is a cour in the distance future and today's. I want to edit one upcoming in a week, but no clue where to find it 🙉 Fix this now please!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and basic , Just best for reminding anything."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"there should be possiblity to add colors and export the list to text or CSV as compatible to other apps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Setting reminders is far more burdensome than the previous way. The layout is not compact. Takes too much time to navigate the app. Boo."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I'm not sure why this was released the reminders on the original Google were so much better. No more geolocation, no mass removal, no mass selection, it's a mess"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app is totally unesrssary. I always used Google keep, it is so simple to write down appointments and set reminders on it. Now with this Task app I have to copy my appointment from keep and then put it in Task. Such a waste of my time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"You have a glitch that stops users from repeating tasks daily simply because they have sun tasks. Please fix"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great and easy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I shouldn't have to download this damn app just to use my reminders but Google is forcing to since it keeps sending duplicate tasks now. GIVE ME MY REMINDERS BACK"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I like the idea of reminders being within the app. What I don't like is I can't select remind me again or snooze in 1 hour like I could before with the regular reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Seriously Google? Not even share a task let alone assign one? Very simple and basic. If you think you're bad with tech, this is for you... But not for the advanced user."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"amazing!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Reminders allowed notifications to be set prior to the event. Tasks does not. I already missed a timed to-do because Google took away reminders and made me switch to tasks. They were so proud of what they were doing they neglected to tell the customer they were taking away a feature. Now I need to look for another app who knows what else I'm going to miss. Thanks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very solid app that integrates well with Google"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Back when we were using reminders , when a reminder shows up, i can simply press ( remind me again in 1 hour ) in case i am busy now, and i dont want many notifications on my phone. But now the only option is ( complete Task ), which means basically is to do it now or forget about it forever. In my opinion, it is a bad upgrade as it should make our life easier. That's a point of a reminder for a guy who forgets more often like me and heavily relies on reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome!!!;) detailing, of knowing yourselves better."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I want to sync my Microsoft to do list with google one"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"There is no way to snooze reminders. Otherwise it does its job well."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it's new to me so I'm sure I'll warm up to it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love it, being able to swipe left and right between multiple lists and the super simple minimal list features. u can organise everything in these simple lists. being able to view completed tasks is helpful too"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"This app is barely ok. The biggest advantage over other apps is Workspace integration, but it's so limited in all other features that it's just not worth it. If you have a recurring task, for example, you can't change which list it's in -- you have to delete the task entirely and create a new one in the new list. That just doesn't make any sense. Not to mention if you have more than a couple lists then it quickly gets very painful to organize anything."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Amended: from 4 to 2 star Combining Tasks and Reminders was a really sucky thing to do; and, worse yet, its execution was even worse ! It left my program for use in shambles, and necessitated I spend about 12 hours (I didñ't REALLY have) restructuring my data to make it readable, understandable, and useful. The end result is not as useful as the separate apps. Google sucks ! I certainly distrust Googles ability to do a decent job of software development before dumping it on the public !!!"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Needs serious work since Google Assistant reminders are turning into Tasks. Tasks should get 'set time' input and choose which tasklist shows up in Google Calendar. Google Calendar should delete the Task from the widget when it's cleared. It's currently cluttered. 'At a Glance' compatibillity...? (Why isn't that syncing? C'mon Google...) Set lists/tasks colors for those who are more visual-minded."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's free, simple, and connected with Google calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app. I use it on a daily basis"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I've used this app for months and it's next to faultless. The only improvement I can suggest is to be able to enter a task and change the category without having to close and reopen. Also, to be able to widen the form on a PC for easier use. Other than that, it serves all my needs."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The layout is so boring and dull how u want users to come on this???"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"sad to see reminders gone!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and effective TODO app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Any to do list / reminder app should have the option to snooze reminders. Currently, the only button on a task reminder is ""Mark as Completed"". The Google Assistant reminders at least had a ""1 hour"" snooze button. Whereas, a snooze option between 15 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day would be ideal."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's fine"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"This app needs alarm based reminders built in before it is actually useful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Uninstalled after 3 attempts to make a simple list, reorganise said list, and make it do what I want, sure it can likely do all the things I want and more, but really it was not intuitive and felt like I should be the one learning how to use it.. Not what I want from a simple to do list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nothing bad..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No offline notification, the app is useless if users need to leave Thier internet on all day just to see tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I lost the ability to modify reoccurring reminders/tasks in the future without it updating the ones before it. Please add this back."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I LOVE IT 💖"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Weeks in the date selector start on Sunday, and it cannot be changed. A large portion of the world starts their week on Monday."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Just useless"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Just began with this app recently, so far so good."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Terrible interface. No calendar view for upcoming tasks - tasks can only be viewed as lists. No way to set a time you want to be notified of a task, like you could with reminders and events in the Calendar app. Uncompleted tasks older than 30 days stop appearing on your ""pending tasks"" list, and there is no setting to change that. If you sort your task list by date, it lists tasks FAR in the future, e.g. ""renew driver's license July 2027"" at the very top, and again no setting to change it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I not liking that I can't change the task with my voice, like i can when I do regular Google reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice simple useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Please add multiple time option for a task. Like if i had to do a task twice a day i have to add 2 separate task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"in a nutshell; it's my brain🥴"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The tasks app has a poor and limited interface. I'm being forced to use tasks because Google is stopping reminders, which is a shame as tasks do not stay in your calendar indefinitely as reminders did."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"task reminders appear to trigger inconsistently. recurring tasks don't always generate. looks like a nice UI, but functionally appears to be hit and miss so far!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Getting much better. It needs a better UI but it finally integrates with assistant."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"If you add sound while tick the task option then it's is very interactive. As well you can add one minimal percentage option ( like battery indication percentage ) which show how much percentage of task have completed today ."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Hate having to go to an app to view my old reminders that have been moved to tasks. Not efficient or convenient. Also can't alter a task once it's created. Can only complete it or star it. Not great. Put reminders back on Google calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Widget doesn't show tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good application Right for the Right job"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's easy now functional this way"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Unlimited groupings. Shows up in Google calendar, so pretty good. The only thing missing is a list that aggregates all tasks due ""today"" from all groups"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"it feels half baked and unintuitive. already. I have so many more reminders and tasks then I feel comfortable with because they were all imported from the other systems. they don't self-delete, which leads to an incredible amount of bloat. When you go to create a new task and then back out immediately, it keeps the empty blank as a task which to me is a sign of incompetent design."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"There's still space for betterment"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Does everything I need it to do."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"luv this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Just what I need"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it would be great and a UI improvement if past, present (today), and future tasks had different colors"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love this app, it keeps me focused and on task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"very practical"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Se deese and r ere in a red"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helps every day. queefer"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Dont know"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I really like the simplicity of the task app, but can you add location based notifications and allow adding locations to certain tasks? Think it would make the user experience better and it's already included on other apps!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"A huge improvement for my experience in the mobile version would be to be able to fold lists of subtasks and also having the Keep Notes' app feature for location-based reminders for work, home or any other location. Thank you! Great app :)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Not sure if I really use it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Does not have snooze option like reminders did. I now cannot migrate back to reminders to get this functionality."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful task tool.. lite and well integrated into google calendar.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Tasks is not bad but can be improved. For example subtasks should be grouped together (under the same task name) when completed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"its so good helps me keep track on my chores"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Hello, your app is great. But can you please let us have an ability to change the color of the task for customization? It's great specially if your using it for school purposes for color coding."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I got a reminder notification about 30 mins late than the specified time. Pixel 6a. Very useful app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please add percentage complete pie chart. It'll be a great help."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Not sure how to use it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Ugh, it's one of the most frustrating apps ever! Where should I even begin? Why are all my past tasks deleted when I just want to remove one from a full list? Why on earth can't I move tasks around?? Why are there so many restrictions??? What the hell is this app even. It is not minimalist but bloodsucking! Hate it!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Why is there no search feature? I would really appreciate one."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I want to sort by ""My Order"", but i cant edit my order from within the app. You also have to choose between a task having subtasks OR being able to be repeated. Example: If you want to make a daily repeating workout of 10 squats, 10 pushups, and 10 jumping jacks, those exercises have to be put in as separate tasks, if you want the repeatability function Edit: I wish I could give this app 0 stars. Not only has it not fixed the above issue, you also cannot simply rearrange the order of your lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Such a nice app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Hate it. Google Reminder was so much better... ever since they changed it, it has become less productive. I'll be switching my reminders to Bixby. Google assistant/ reminder was great and help keep things in check .... you switching that to task just ruined it😡😡"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Can't reorder tabs bar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great minimalistic, a great way to keep track of all my daily, weekly tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Not so flexible. I need tasks to have a start and end time. Impossible to reorder tasks lists....etc"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I get my reminders, on time, all the time. But I either don't get the tasks or I get them only when I open the tasks app. Please don't take reminders away. The tasks app failed to notify me many many times."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Great👍 to see the integration with google calendar app, So far so good... 👉Feedback: 1. UI needs to be improved, 👉2. Adding a subtask feature while creating the repeating tasks, might be a great although..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple and easy to use , no busy design or confusing settings. 👍👍👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Too much lag while switching tabs"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Well touch"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"More colour options, fonts and symbols other than the star required."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Does not communicate with google calender."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works seamlessly with gmail"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Grat option for all the people who doesn't want to miss a thing! ✔️📝"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Awful. Constantly sending me odd reminders about notifications expiring. I wish I'd never swapped to using tasks. No option to snooze reminders anymore. They seem to randomly disappear. Default ordering is somehow not by date of task. Avoid for as long as you can."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This does Not appear 10 be shareable"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Tasks notification stopped working. Uninstalled Google Tasks and my Google Calendar task notifications began working again. They coexisted fine for several months until recently."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very straightforward and simple. it would be nice to share tasks with others."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Needs better notifications."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"categorize tasks days automatically like Microsoft to do list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Could be so much better! I'm giving up on this app. It's far more frustrating than it is useful. Apparently you can either have recurring tasks or subtasks--but not both. Trying to edit existing tasks is an exercise in futility."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"There's none thus far, we're learning."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I give this app 4 stars because I don't know how to put a alarm for my tasks. This app is very good because it alows me to creat new list and also put tick on them but actually it's a upgraded copy of my list in excel or in Google excel."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Can not set up specific notification sound, notification sound only for Google task... Also don't see option ""remind me xx min before"""
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Buena"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google Tasks starts my day every day and keeps me on point throughout my day with a separate list for any category under the sun of MY choosing."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"O app desempenha sua função de maneira simples e direta, isso me cativou bastante. No entanto, senti falta de um apelo a interface visual. Além disso, senti falta da opção de definir cores para as tarefas, com o intuito direcionar melhor a organização das tarefas."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Too minimal. Can't do what reminders expected do. I just lost all my calendar reminders to this poor feature by accepting prompt to covert them into tasks. Extremely disappointed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Useless. I whish i could get a daily (customizable time) notification for not completed task. This way i'm just getting listed every not completed task still reminders are exluded without any notification and extra stress. Aslo it's useless to move reminder into tasks and it's so confusing. Plese keep reminder and tesks all together in the same space and PLESE add a customizable time notification for not completed task this way I'm not just letting them die as being forgot in my calender."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I'd be very satisfied with gTasks if they allowed 1) API access to read/write time, not just date, and 2) if the Android notification panel allowed a ""snooze 1hr"" (or similar) option. The former would be convenient to have tasks apps integrate and then appear seamlessly in gCal. Other standard tasks apps features are also missing from the app. But instead of substantially improving the app features, it would do wonders if the devs just open up the API!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Make subtasks repeat and I'd give this a 5/5."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"the 9nly reason it doesn't have a 5th star it's because Gtask doesn't have a search 🔍 feature. other than that it's an app you can't live without"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"2020.01.10 спасибо за напоминания как для задач, так и для подзадач. Использую в связке с Деловой календарь 2, чтобы задачи появлялись в календаре."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Fernando ¹"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like tasks because u can create them or i should say they create themselves for example from an email if u need to remind yourself or have a deadline you send it to tasks and boom it's there. That is just one example. The only thing I don't like which isn't a big deal just a personal thing I would like it to be more, oh i don't know, colorful, alive in some way. it's just dull but other than that it's a good app to have if you use Google apps."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's really improved but I wish there was a Today and Tomorrow section and not just lists. Starring really helps isolate tasks and of course the Gmail feature is perfect. There are integrations through IFTTT and Zapier too. I wish there was a standalone desktop app. C'mon Google!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I like the app idea, but there are a couple of major issues. First, there's a 30% chance that a subtext added on one device will sync weird on another device, causing the subtext to disappear on both, which is extremely frustrating. By the time you notice, you have forgotten it, as you wrote it down to remember. Second, it is just a bit too clunky for an app that doesn't do much."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Very bland uninteresting UI No fancy animations or fun features... I would much rather use Microsofts todo list app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Need to get this done"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It works OK, but the widget support is poor. Only one widget with no customisation options. The order that it displays tasks in seems random, it would be better if it sorted by date. Please improve the widget support!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"ever since downloading I no long get any type of a reminder whether I do a reminder by saying hey Google or do it through the task app and yes all the reminders are selected."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It would be great if there was a search engine"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"While this is functional, I much prefer Google Keep as it's just more pleasant to use. Perhaps a merge is in need here?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Very bad experience"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Needs to be able to share task list with another person like keep notes"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps me keep track of All my Schedules. Love this"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great productive"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It would be better if the description can have checkboxes as well"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The APK looks updated, but please can you guys make the new items go to the last session rather than the beginning I will really appreciate that, A curious user..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Best side of this app is, as a part of google family, can be synched with my google calender and have basic organizing capacity. Some features might make it a more powerfull organizer!! - 1. List or tasks or both can be shared with other google users. 2. Tasks can be color coded 3. All today’s tasks can be shown on one place 4. Sub-tasks can also be able to dated and shown on calender Hope for positive feedback!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it! keeps me on task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Nice design, great overall, would love if it had intrgration with keep notes"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice interface very organised"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Add the ""every minute"" time in app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's very convenient to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"only self study"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I've tried many apps for keeping track of my to-do lists, but none have been this convenient! the app interconnectivity is where Tasks truly shines!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I would give this app a perfect score except for one major thing. When you create a task, it automatically makes the task 30 min. Even when you sync and open on Google Calendar, you can't edit how long the task is. I really really hope they give a start/ stop time for task. If they do I'm changing to 5 stars easily."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Will give this 5 stars if I can personalise the widget opacity and colour. Edit: I can't add subtasks like it's being advertised"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Excellent app,i use it daily and all my tasks are synced across all devices. Makes my small business easier.. i also suggest you make the tasks for the day move to the top of the list, pushing the yesterday undone once at the bottom most side. Makes it easier for scrolling and lookig for the upcoming. Thank you!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Microsoft To-Do has one button that lets me share a list with multiple users able to live affect the items on it. Why Google tasks doesn't have such a basic function....I can't say. Use To-Do by Microsoft. It's just as simple\usee friendly but with way more utility"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So far it's like a apple Siri. It helps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I downloaded several task/ planner apps. This ended up being the easiest and most user friendly option for me. It has very needed and useful features, one being automatically adding the tasks to my calendar and creating my schedule for me. If this doesn't work for you, try using the task/ reminder app that compliments the calendar you're already using."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"a good app to follow the tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't notify me on a set time. I tried with 2 different tasks. Notification permission was set to allowed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"What happened to my tasks widget? Ridiculous!! Why would you remove something that was working well?!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Can you work on the choice of notifications? Can we have the freedom to customize our own notifications? Can you add features like ability to add map links and photos? Thanks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google Text-to-Speech services plus the task app makes me feel comfortable knowing that I can get my day to day without missing a beat"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Would be awesome if you could make the widget disappear when you finish all your tasks"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it is useful for simple task management. No grouping /multiple priority managemnt is available"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"very helpful app!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"little bit easy to use app then others"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It is a little hard to find the tasks. Hard to set up properly."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love being able to schedule little reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"the app should have the option to postpone a task also like gmail, it should have swipe to delete"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"having a list of tasks to do in your daily life gives you the confidence to really do something positive in your life and this app provides it all for you"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Exceeds my expectations, easy to integrate exciting tasks in other apps!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Every new day I start with this application. It is not loaded with unnecessary features and at the same time has almost everything you need. I express my deep gratitude to the developers! But the application could become really perfect if it were possible to manually sort also in the ""Starred"" list, as it already is in other created lists. There are only two sorting options available in this list, and they are not suitable for all cases. In the future, I expect that this feature will be added!👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Pray to help me important tasks to improve."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"WHY DONT I GET SOUND OR AN OPTION FOR SOUND AMD VOLUME FOR MY REMINDERS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love this application!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It's really disappointing that Google doesn't give Tasks the attention it deserves. There's no Pixel Watch app and I am not able to make sure the week displayed while scheduling starts on Monday like Calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"NOT helpful to ME ONLY sends silent texts all at the same time EVERYDAY i NEED it to remind ME throughout the day via sound"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Terrible!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It would be nice to ask Google to create tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Works as advertised. One issue is repeating tasks disappear from the list when an instance is marked as completed. It would be better if the next instance immediately appeared as a future task, instead of waiting until the next instance's day to reappear. Also, if I want to delete completed tasks, then completed instances of repeating tasks should also be deleted. I have hundreds of instances of repeating tasks in my completed section that can't be deleted."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"What the ..?? No alphabetical sort option??! Shocking😲! Come on now! Even Microsoft ToDo app has that rudimentary feature which is a must to rearrange a simple list. Please add SORT BY ITEM feature A..Z"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Looks fine but why separate application? Kindly Integrate with Google calender with all features."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This is the lowest effort from Google ever. No ability to add sub tasks for repeating tasks, I can only either make repeating single tasks or one time tasks with sub-tasks, can't move recurring tasks to another list. Would be better to use tags for organizing instead of lists, like Google keep does."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It`s not quite an app, it`s rather an ad-on to Gmail and Calendar. I`d like to see it as a standalone app. An integration with Keep and possibly Maps would be useful. At present the main lack is of a focused My Day screen."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This app is simple and easy to use, but I don't like the way it handles subtasks. Subtasks should always appear under the primary task unless they are marked as complete, and completing all subtasks should automatically complete the primary task. For example, when you star a primary task, it should automatically add stars to all subtasks, and when you mark a subtask as uncompleted it should automatically mark the primary task as uncompleted."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Sooooo... Why can't I search? Why can't I see all lists at once? Why can't I select the order on the widget? This really makes me want to go back to the third party app that plugs into the Google Tasks API. 4 years later, still the same issues."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"needs an archive function. I have over a hundred reminders that were moved to tasks. such as change as air filter house every 3 mos. Change air filter car every year. no way to hide them as in keep.

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Would be even more useful if google assistant would be able to create tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Need to be able to create via Google assistant before reminders disappear"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Could not live without this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great song's to listen"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This app works great except for one issue, I have weekly tasks, I can't see how to mark a task this week so that next week's task is shown as incomplete"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Task and reminder notification is not working 😠"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"🌏🌞🦅🌚🔯🤴🏼🎅🏻Genius ⭐boy 0:0"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"How can this not have a trash?? Somehow my huge shopping list gets deleted on the one very hot day when we finally can go to town - and it's just GONE. That's it. No recovery. To think that I trusted this app all this time and never checked on that one basic necessity. Just assumed. My list was as gone as if it flew out the window going over a canyon. Now I read some very bitter remarks from other people the same thing has happened to. Wow."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"it cqnnot save what I added info offline"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Unable to share list. Pointless"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this! I like having all my tasks in one spot as well as on my calendar. Great organization tool!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"easy to use. would be good to have the option to write notes on the task itself"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's great! Cheers sweetie, thanks a lot."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Cannot share task lists which makes this a personal only task list which means you have to add and complete them yourself."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Simple and straightforward to use. the only thing I noticed is recurring tasks don't have a subtask feature, and it isn't possible to share task lists between different users."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Too less features.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Google is attempting to merge reminders, Keep, and to-do lists into one thing - 'Tasks' - which just isn't possible. A 'to-do' and a 'reminder' *are not the same thing*. To-dos often have a deadline, for example, which this app doesn't support. A reminder at a certain time may not need to be 'completed' or even put in the calendar, like ""reminder that the metro isn't running today"". On top of that, Assistant doesn't currently work with Tasks, despite my Pixel pushing me to migrate to tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"sometimes the widget doesn't show the task list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I wish when I said reminders or remind me it would go to this app. using Google assistant"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome 😍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Just the to-do list I was looking for that does not take up a lot of storage on your phone. Can make multiple lists; great feature."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Tasks doesn't sync with Samsung Reminders and is useless with a Galaxy Smart Watch."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Never used"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome thanks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"i😙"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Don't know if it's ready yet"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very helpful in my day to day basis. keeps me on track"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very basic and functional task manager that integrates with Google calendar seamlessly. It would be good to include a simple pomodoro timer inside. My work flow is pomodoro timer and the work on the tasks. So I am manually setting my phone alarm."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's a emergency I need to talk to my only preteen and girls and 6"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Thankyou."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy to use and update"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Very disappointing. Integration with Calendar is lacking. Creating tasks for other users via their email was not intuitive (couldn't make it happen). Notifications are lacking."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"O ecossistema Google é o melhor para mim que amo Android. O Tarefas já linka com a minha Google Agenda e é ótimo. Melhor app com toda certeza."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"get error with widget"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"No problems and very easy to use., useful for me as I have a bad memory."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very nice. It's helps me a lot. It is simple and easy to configure. Has check boxes so that once we complete our tasks we can check them and strike them off. Love it's ease of use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"There should be an option that makes easy to move tasklist anywhere. And there should be a dashboard which we track our work list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"There should be a feature to set multiples reminder in a single day on different time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"optional"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"App is good but it need some changes as per new daily requirements"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Finally a widget!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"To limited for me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I like the simplicity of this app and that it syncing with google calendar. But it impossible to set the duration of a task, which is basic. Also will be nice if tasks could go to any calander."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I want to completely delete my account from this because it isn't doing anything good for me and I don't like it also"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I need a function not provided. I would like to be able to set tasks for once every 3 days or once every 2 days, not just once weekly daily or monthly. Theres very few things in life I do once that I need constant reminders for. I realize I could set 2 weekly reminders on separate days if I need bi- weekly or tri-weekly tasks, but that's not exactly what I'm looking for because weeks have odd days; and it's a lot more work for something that should be in the frequency drop down menu."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"my new to do task manager. allows for subtasks and deadline dates"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"would be better if there were a way to share tasks with others"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Unable to rearrange the list already made from top"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The app is very basic. You can't change the order, color, delete or edit any tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple. Easy to use. Generally it's meets your needs."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I don't know about the app but i think is a nice app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Everything is simple and good. But it would be better if it was possible to write from right to left. It is also not possible to bold the text. And how can I rearrange the lists?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Okay"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I downloaded this to coordinate a checklist with my husband for our rennovation projects. The app description claims the app is ""integrated with Gmail for easy collaboration."" Well, I am not seeing that option AT ALL eithet on the app or on Gmail. And when I Googled for help, sure enough, I need to use third party sites/apps for this function, and everything becomes very convoluted. Guess I will delete this app shortly because it is really no more useful than a notepad style app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice little app that compliments my calendar well. I cannot always get the little things on the calendar without making a mess but I can track them off the calendar but still be alerted if needed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Not bad, the ordering lists feature (afaik only possible via browser) would be a nice addition. Also still seeing subtasks when organized by date. Also can't add subtasks to a recurring task. Microsoft's To Do app is superior in every way"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"These task are not completed if so were are they going because I haven't seen one completion"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"All of my reminders disappeared from my calendar and nothing is working. I have to use a new app apparently and it still won't show my reminders that I need. This might be the issue that makes me switch to a competitor."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Completely Unnecessary: The addition of this app as opposite to keeping it with Google assistant makes this completely unecessary addition. It did not import even half of my original scheduled reminders, and I have had to recreate them all. On top of that, tasks are far more jumbled and labeling things is as ""hands free"" as possible, and encourages you to use your voice rather than type things in, which is inherently prone to errors. Google LLC needs to stop spreading all it's functions out."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this app is pretty amazing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It was aight"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app by Google is quintessential to ensuring specific tasks are brought to the forefront of your daily activities. Many times a day, small items are forgotten or swept under the rug. Sometimes these are meaningless and other times paramount to running a productive daily schedule. We all need reminders and this app stands apart due to its integration with Google's calendar. As a lifelong Android and Google user, I implore you to leave no task incomplete by way of incorporating this app!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"good app but order of task should be first input on the top of list than other bcz what we add in list first which is most important"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Fine"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Add to tasks not showing up in options menu in my gmail How to fix this"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"There should be option of shifting tasks from one list to another. And also, moving tasks according to priority."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent organisation tool."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I setup a qlink account and qlink shipped me a cim card but ups delayed my delivery of my sim card on 04/08/2023 and that was three weeks ago and I still have not received my simcard for qlink so I canceled my service today qlink needs it pull three heads out of there assuming and help there customers when they have problems like this instead of doing nothing at all to resolve problems like this!!!!!!poor customer service"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No searching No today view Problems syncing to Google calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I have no memory. now I do."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Minimal, doesn't get bogged down in endless features, and integrates nicely with Google calendar. However, there's just some really weird things about it that seem like lazy, bad design and make the app unusable: You can't move a task to another list if it recurs. If you try to delete the recurrence, you still can't move it. You can't (re)add a recurrence - it just remains greyed out. You can't re-order lists, tasks or subtasks. You can't group lists."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Excellent and easy but I think if you add tracking of tasks it will be better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"really helpful tool app that has helped me organise my school work and tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very useful app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No Search option?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not reusable- there's no way to change tasks from complete to incomplete."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good but maybe it should have a list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it would be better if I can number the subtask"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"surprised at how much I get done ✅ and pretty easy to navigate"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Would be nice to be able to mark that you've done a take in the past..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Sequence Coding..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"not very good understandable what do you done and what have to do"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very useful app. I am using it since 5+ years. Only 1 feature i would request is, if we can have sharing option. So multiple users(e.g me & my wife) can add and get reminders for the tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Goood App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"rehmat"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"This is one and only app which perfectly syncs with Google calender and helps to keep a track on my events and tasks. Absolutely free app to create unlimited lists and subtasks. BUT, I have 2 problems. 1) There's no feature to add a tag to task. 2) In Google calender, there could be an option to change colour of task according to which list a particular task belong to. I hope these 2 features would soon be available."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I love this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Sabbir"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This is the second time Google has overhauled tasks/reminders and both times were unnecessary. If my reminders were converted to tasks, why is this app needed at all? I can only see upcoming items with Google Calendar anyway, but now it's more difficult. The problem is that tasks and reminders are, by definition, different things. A task is something added immediately, even if you have weeks to finish it. Reminders are for planning ahead of time: ""a package arrives today."" That's not a task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"very good service."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Shareable list? Without having to go through taskboard on which sharing doesn't work either..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Amazing app works great with my phon and any computer with loged into Google but I wish it would keep my daily repeating task in my order so I don't have to reorganize the evry morning and I wish thair was app that works with my wach to sink my task to my smart watch."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's a great organization app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Adding new features whould be much better."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Hi Google! You need to make the lists rearrangeable! It is very important!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app. Really helps with my adhd"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Useful for everyone. I can maintain my tasks date by date.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"please add more options, like alarm or reminder pop-up, colour options for each event or tasks, add calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"La razón principal por la cual tengo está app es que se encuentra sincronizada con mi Google Calendar. Sin embargo, me gustaría que en su interfaz no estuvieran en ventanas diferentes cada categoría sino fuera un scroll si clasificadas pero se vieran en una sola página."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Unbelievable"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"تحفة 🌹"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I really grew to love this app, I'm very comfortable with it I've been through a lot of ups and downs but more downs for about 6 years and I can't imagine being able to handle certain people as well as the event along with the most interesting topics. I like how I can choose what kind of topic each time. Quora is the best educational & respectful app. I am now aware of (live vs living) I gained positivey. Thank you Quora."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"framed by everyone"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's was ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Lovw the simplicity and effectiveness."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Virtually useless. Unable to set reminder tones within app, or am I missing something. There is no settings menu. If I have to search around to find it, the app is really poor."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"handy, use it a lot. missing ability to export or print on mobile app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Stupid you have to verify yourself over and over again just to get to tasks who's going to try and hack your tasks that's the Google account interfering I've been having trouble with that bullcrap all day too I suggest you get a pen and paper do it the old way write down what you gotta do you can get your tasks done quicker than trying to get them off the app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Chrome needs to be installed and upgraded on phone to make the alarm sound. Unfortunately I hate Chrome so I uninstalled it. Now the alarm is not working 🙂 Google always make their apps which depend on other google apps. We are paying for our phone, internet but who gave you right to install those ram engulfing, uninstalable apps like chrome, play services, and playstore, and gmap etc which are always running at background without our consent."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app. Love the concept. I'm just really bad when it comes to lists. I don't work well with lists lol. I will do everything except what's on my list that's the only reason I don't use it often. But this is really a great app."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Garbage. No notification ability, total useless."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I can keep organized in a flash with this. Though, Google AI doesn't seem to recognize it, I've yet to find the alarms to notify me within the app for advanced notice (like in Google Calendar). This is still one of the best apps I've discovered thus far on assisting me with keeping on a schedule of specified listed items. Like a shopping list or activity ledger, ingredients/materials list for a recipe or an enemy/ally hit-list in a game. Just category, title, description, date/time & you're set."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Ако искате да откажете потребителите си от услугите на Гугъл - Google Tasks е правилното приложение! Започвам с кратко изброяване- 1.Няма начин да въведеш повече от един акаунт едновременно; 2. Не можеш да избереш НИКАКВИ опции на това приложение! На практика СЕТИНГС е просто празен бутон без никаква функция; 3. Дизайнът е меко казано смехотворен - едноцветен, неразбираем, трудно схватлив, трудно ориентируем. Графиката за това приложение е правена от дете в 8-ми клас. Слабо!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Please Add Search options in App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"A simple and good app, but due to some unknown reason after the update now having trouble loading the widget on lawnchair launcher app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Hey, can you please make older tasks allow recurring scheduling too, like new ones do? Thanks a bunch!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Sync and ecosystem features are good, but task app specific features are lacking, for example, the subtasks aren't made to look like subtasks bit rather show up in the main task list."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It is rally very helpful app. Specially for a student."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it is a good tool, but there aren't many options, as to put how long the task should last"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Google Tasks fulfils it purpose... a checklist that you can tick off as you complete tasks. It helps me remember what I need to do, but it's pretty basic. However, I still like the app and would recommend it, but I liked apple's reminders better."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good tool to have and put into practice. currently used to having a paper list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I been using Tasks/Reminder for for about 6 years now and I love how all my tasks come across all my devices to keep me on schedule, using just my voice to create the reminder.

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Perfect to do list app. I use the GTD method and GTasks allows me to follow that without getting too complicated. I would love it if we could use Google assistant with it, collapse subtasks and have recurring subtasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"PLEASE add option on notification to ""remind in one hour"" instead of just mark and completed. My phone forced me to start using this instead of Google reminders which I use daily. With reminders I used to be able to press ""1 hour"" and it would remind me again in 1 hour. I really rely this function (I use it very often for reminding me to take medication and if I cannot at the time then reminding in 1 hour is vital). Please please pls add an option on the notifications to remind in 1 hour"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Never really used this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Adding Location Based Reminders and Photos in reminders would make this a 5 star app."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great and perfect, there's none that fits what I need like this, and that's why it's a little frustrating. Please, let's be able to reorder the lists (the horizonal plane like we can do for the tasks) please 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 That's all I'm asking for, please"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It's great for something in a pintch but not like I thought a task app would be. I'm definitely not using it much, But just Google I can get my reminders for whatever, a list to get at the store , to remember what goes into a recipe."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The entry should automatic save when we close the app right after typing something. App needs improvement."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"""Week is starting with Sunday and there is no option to change it."" This was published 2 years ago. Nothing changed.

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Please consider the following suggestions: make the tasks foldable (to hide subtask) Subtask cannot be added when a reapeted reminder is set. Why not make both options available. Make the horizontal tasks arrangeable. Thank you. Will update my review once you reply!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Cool, now integrate it with Google Assistant. Also allow reordering lists. Bonus points for a Swift Mac app. Navigating lists is laggy, please fix it. Especially when tapping lists far apart. Autofill schedule using language in the task like Todoist does. Show up in Google Calendar apps in desktop as well. Don't entirely delete sub tasks upon completion. Just cross them off."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy and simple to use but efficient!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"please let me install it on wear os... 😔"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it's excellent and simple, but without the ability to have shared task lists with others then it is fatally limited and will never be my default task list app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Please provide search option"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Forget all other task applications. Google nailed it with this app. I use it for work and personal life. auto synchs across devices and is embedded in desktop Gmail."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"5 stars if we can share lists or export them. No such option."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Yeah right"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Can't share to do list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Still undecided"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works well to keep me on track"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Usefull app for students."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It's not notifying task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Please make it available for PC also. So that I can see my tasks on my laptop as well. Thabkyou"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Good app but not working offline😞"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good for keeping track"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very useful and handy, it helps with getting tasks completed and keeping them organized. I use it for work tasks and personal tasks. The reminder tool is especially helpful. I set a date and a time and it notifies me to have it done by that time. Great app overall."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Alhamdulillah"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great organizing and perfect representation of task bars."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Would like sorting of lists left to right"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"add location and attachments to tasks. since reminders moved into tasks need to reference documents or links or location for a task. these are valuable fields."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"devonacha ekan. thank you"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Nice up but i cant use on other devices like laptops"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"If your one to stay active and organized like myself. This is a must have app on your phone or computer. You can create category tabs. Within those tabs make notes doc appts, memos at your finger tips and just a click away.You can enter a date time to call up your task and it syncs with Google Calendar.Open your calendar and there's everything in one place. That's the best part of this app. And I believe you can link it with Google assistant. So simple to use , not like others thats out there."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's great! Although it would be better if we could color code the tasks in the calendar to be more organized when it comes to the importance of the task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It works great for me , it's easy to use. I love it !"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Usefull but for app integrated with calendar i stll need it connected with keep or this 3 app better integrated"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It doesn't align with Google Assistant nicely, it needs a lot of input from me at this point.... like a week in."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"could have easier accessibility. for instance when completing a subtask should include the heading of main task when showing in completed tab!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good and useful app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Useless to me?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Worked fine."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"All good, but sub tasks within a task shouldn't show up in main task list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome for the beginner. especially if you have a horrible memory.!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Sometimes it doesn't even notify. It doesn't have badge when there is expired task. I did a experiment to notify a task at 15:15. It didn't notify but one another should have notified at 11:00 notified at 15:15."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Tasks is a great BASIC todo app. I wish there were more things like sharing a task I have to do with someone else, refresh for task widget, reminder option for task E.G 15 minutes 30 minutes etc. It feels like someone developed the app got it to a point and then stopped. There are no bells and whistles."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Still need to have the option to sort the tasks as we prefer. Everything else is good."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Please make application for watches"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Cannot have reminders and collaborators for tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"does not look or work like shown. No Sub task available to enter. works like entering a task in the calendar no extra options or features."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Propose to add sub-tasks or steps like Microsoft To-Do"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Helps me remember EVERYTHING (ALMOST)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and effective. I appreciate the streamlined approach of this app and it's integration to Google Calendar. If you're looking for something that's quick and easy to use - this is it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"yall consist of many blessings that God loves of yall ,I discern thee blessings of y'all because y'all still living on God's planet earth ,there something within our soul that we all have to let go ,you aware of what that is ,just imagine you in front of thee Almighty Ghost Spirit of God Mightiness in prestige majesty of love admiring thou Angels spiritual productions of thy spirit then consider thee actions you implemented compared to God's sacred heart feelings of sacred magical miracle ."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The app ui is fine,my issue is to do with the lack of notification sounds or the ability for the app to make my phone do more than vibrate once to notify me, it really brings the whole experience down in my opinion"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very nice app for productivity."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Why can't I change the details of 1 instance of a recurring task through this app, if I'm able to do it through the calendar app? You forced everyone to switch over but there's still a big feature gap."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"help me a lot to her denies my schedule beautiful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Getting used to Tadks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app has been so helpful for me because it helps me stay together in the mornings so I don't freak out on what to do."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"when you complete a repeated task, it disappears instead of showing in its next schedule"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is exactly what I was looking for. Let's me track short term and moderate term tasks easily with separate lists. If it's a date/time sensitive task, shows up on my Google calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good app for managing time for study a"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Really good app.if you read rules and instructions. I'm guilty of not doing so"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ya it's very good experience but ple improve a search bar on top bcs every to do task have first search bar so ple update"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"fast and convenient. like it for work"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good App for remembering tasks and priorities them...!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"To me,the best👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I mean it does what is meant to do but what a sad app you can change colors of the task nor any kind of personalization, sad and death"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The web version has a minor ""bug,"" which a task could easily be wiped by ""click-drag"" accidentally. And it's no way to recover! *sigh*"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I have not had a chance to give this one a try so I went ahead and downloaded it from my Gmail I couldn't figure out what was blocking the information requested pertaining to work last time.,. I'm going to hope we nailed it this time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"widget not working"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The organization of Google Tasks is intuitive and useful, I also like that the tasks are integrated with Calendar 📆. I do think that the app needs more notification options to make it useful. Like if I have an important task to do in the morning of a specific day or time range, I would like the notification to be persistent until I finish the task. Until it has at least the persistent reminder-like notification this will be not as useful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Thank you Google tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good to organiselife"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I only put my google account and password in it so my channel got hacked still not recovered"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it can be good if you add reminder on this app.Overall a usefull application."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Akan lebih bagus lagi jikalau aplikasi ini diintegrasikan ke keep notes jadi gak kebayakan aplikasi pakk"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Some recurring tasks are only visible under ""Completed"" even if there are future ones that are not completed. This needs to be fixed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please add reminders and priority options for each task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"really useful, would be lost without it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Let's get"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"help"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Does not auto synchronize items between collaborators on a shared list which makes the app completely useless..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Man..... Amazing. This is literally good. Just fix some bugs like some of the tasks get automatically blank ... 👾"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Add transparent widget"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"برنامج رائع الداره المهام"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It is missing a lot of features such as hiding the completed tasks or putting reminders. But it's ok."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Superb! Especially the reminders r very customisable. Just need the option to reorder lists (not the tasks in the lists)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"No app for Windows so I can't sync the things I need to do from phone you laptop. This has always been Google's weakness. Microsoft has the Microsoft To Do app available for Android and can be synced with the Windows app. So that is better for me. Google has so much money and still missing the Mark."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Tasks won't show up on my Pixel watch, huge fail Google. Otherwise love the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I'm having trouble learning how to use it. it's supposed to be quick but it's not easy to know how. I'd like to know because it could be a good tool. please include tutorial with it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app fails at everything. It doesn't even send reminders out on time. I've missed important things due to this apps failure to deliver notifications on time. I've had notifications deliver over 24 hours AFTER they were supposed to come through! Most of the time they won't be delivered at all until you open the app, then they all come through at once. Not to mention you cannot mark tasks as complete. The button on the notification does nothing whatsoever. This app is a failure, find another."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good great 👍 thanks for your service ❤️ you all 🙏"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Lots to like 👍🏼, one NOT to... 😔 for *repeating* tasks update 'ALL' *SHOULD NOT* affect completed tasks - just lost a load of history 😔²"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Waist of the time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great for organizing and planning using checkbox style note keeping with customizable lists or groups for sorting different tasks in specific categories. I am using Tasks to help plan my life and work goals and To-dos. Tasks is helping me stay on top of things."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Hope it can let me to adjust the order of my lists. Hope it also can add subtasks for repeating tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Only works for one time tasks. Reoccurring tasks functionality is garbage, it's a known issue for years and nothing has been done to fix it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Overall good app. i like the integration with the calendar and the assistant"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I've lots of trouble with my acc. Since I tried to get boost HELP, but never got through the front page which is so hard for us consumers, we need your HELP to finish this right? Julie Kimura! Please Help me through this? T-Mobils' Android? Please deliver this over to Experian which can probably HELP ME through!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best app for aad any reminder any task. This can be more usefull application for software developer and project manager"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Google hasn't impeded a way to send email objects to your calendar with full details similar to how Outlook does. Instead they make yet another new app to use and the interoperability is laughable. I can send things from Gmail to Gtasks, but it only copies the name and 0 other data. Create an option where I can push emails from my Gmail natively to a calendar object."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful for personal short note and daily basis task tracking."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love the app thank you."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this app! One of my favourite apps to date. So easy to use and very handy."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Enjoy the game"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This app is wonderful. I just have one thing to say and I just hope they consider fixing this. When we add a task, we can repeat it. But when we add a subtask we can't repeat it. I think this should be fixed. Thanks for reading."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"this application could have more interaction with calendar events and let users edit the task to a event in every moment, with the data the task have. it's not a good user experience when both services are from the same source."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"How to open y screen if I forgot password"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best To-do organiser app. Could be even better with a Gantt chart like ability to visually map different tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I'm NOT a fan of Microsoft. But keep going back to it and having team members making accounts just so I can assign tasks. I can't manage task to other people ( work or personal life) with this app or any functionality from Google. I prefer Google over Microsoft and their office programs and apps. Rather have 1 app that do everything and 4 or 5 apps and/or make new accounts for everything else just to keep productivity current and up to date. Calender is good. But maybe integrate tasks or ""todo"""
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Making tasks easier"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great services"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"There must be alarm to invoke."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Neat and Simple."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Great concept, but lacks normal features that other To-Do lists have. Saving tasks can be arrgravating. I save the text but if I back out or switch apps,It does not save. An auto save/cached feature would be awesome."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app.!!! Simple-To-Use-This-Is- A-Great-Functioning-Format. Fred Steward"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Protection spell 360"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is the only routine sort of app that I have consistently used and not given up on. It is straight forward and intuitive. Lastly it's always nice to have the Google ""flavor"" of UI. Here's to new updates and fixes. 🥂🍷🍾"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"its 100 % perfect and easy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Please add share list or task with someone straight from the app, or add someone in the task, at least start with add a Gmail user if possible."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This is a great app. The only thing I would like to see change is for reoccuring tasks once completed to show the next occuring one in the to be completed section. It's a tad frustrating when you have to go through all the completed ones to see when a reoccurring one will come up next."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"simple to use, integrates into Google calendar, limited but adequate options"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Effective but Basic - 3 out of 5 Stars Google Tasks is a straightforward task management tool that aims to simplify the process of organizing daily tasks and reminders. While it offers some useful features, its overall functionality leaves much to be desired, earning it a 3 out of 5 stars."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"No way to reorder lists in app. Tasks have no end date or duration. Would be great if lists could be coloured differently. Would be great to have the above two and integrate them into Calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Like the new design, but man this needs family sharing function."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"What is the usefulness of a tasks application without notifications and reminders ? I remove it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple but effective. I use it for shopping lists, to tick off my gym routine and daily to do list at work."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this app. An invaluable tool that I use daily. It has an alarm to go off and remind me to the time it's set for. Very helpful for the forgetful such as myself. It has a subtasks for each task too. you can add things from the web or from an e-mail and clicking on it will open it. We'll done, Google!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"i think this app is a good start.it d be meganice to be able to link the lists between each other, like a mind map."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"You cannot sort it. This is a must feature. How would you prioritize the tasks. Don't you want to know any task that must be accomplished in chronological order. I googled the instructions, and people complained about lack of feature back in 2019. They were hoping enough complain will make google change. Four years later, google still doesn't care. 1 star."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"COMPLETE BENEFITS! THANK YOU"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Nice for phones. But can you recommend any client for laptop with Windows?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"pomodoro"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I can't get it to work with Google assistant. I would also like to see some of my tasks on the lock screen."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"amazing and extremely good for organizing your tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Almost what I need, time allotment is a major tool for effective task planning. If I could alot 2hours at 5pm to a task, then have that appear on my Google calendar, this would be a great tool for planning out my day."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple and easy task creator."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app, though it'd be lovely to have a today section for an intersection of tasks from lists happening today."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I love this app 😍 but I need to share some of my lists with other google users. Make it happen for 5 stars."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"dark widgets please"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Loved it fr the beginning"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice and easy to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best to do list app The only problem is that for every item that you want to add to a single list, you need to push + botton every single time!!!! Please fix this, and it would become flawless Best feature is to be able to add widgets for each list with visible contents Easy to add new items from widget. Thank you for this great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"simple clean design works well enough and integrates with other Google apps though it is kind of baffling and I guess not the fault of the app that it doesn't integrate with Google voice that seems like a pretty significant limitation."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"tasks are great! I love the build in to the calendar and functional approach. I just wish tasks had its own page in chrome and could be printed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Im not really sure what google tasks is for!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Tasks and Subtasks works nice, UI and widget are very simple"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Decent app overall. Main request would be to collapse subtasks for easier viewing. It already happens when holding to move position and looks alot cleaner with an arrow showing how many are in the main task. More granular sorting options would be decent as well. I also can't seem to reorder Task headings at least in the app so new ones always go to the left."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Google is useless. There is no way to look at your task which used to be reminders, as you cannot get it to start at the newest task which would be tomorrow's task instead they show you your pass tasks and then go on from there. Why wouldn't you just use the reminders instead of incorporating all this ridiculous nonsense into one useless app. Was this done by someone who's woke or needs to join the pride Nation"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Needs to show all tasks without switching accounts It's fine for basic usage but lacking for anyone with two or more accounts. Also, the widget seriously needs a view to show from all lists sorted by starred and due date. Markdown support would also be great."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and sinks with calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"supper"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and effective task tool for your everyday needs. It can also sync the tasks with your Google account."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"it doesn't let me move task to another category. I had birthdays saved on my calender as a reminder. when I first opened task, it automatically moved to my general task list but I wanted them on birthday list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Win"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Very few features"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Does not support smartwatch. Web version supports features this app does not making it hard coordinate tasks between devices."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Awesome app, can't wait till Google shuts this one down and makes me switch to yet another new reminders app!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"very useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"deleted within 5 minutes. I was looking for a notepad type app that would (effectively) make different lists (such as a groceries, repairs, to do, etc, etc). I installed tasks. Made a grocery list. But apparently Google thinks it is a good idea to have each item on said list entered separately and saved, then enter (+) the next item and save. And so on and so forth. I have used other apps that allows one to make a list, open it and add or subtract from it at will while it auto saves when closed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Its good really but it'll be better if tasks have repeated weekly twice like Monday Wednesday etc"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"even with notifications allowed, do not get them regularly to my phone .. which was the reason for wanting to use this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app to remember things with"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google tasks are phenomenal for planning out your day. The critique I have about Google is at a certain point, a Google task overlaps with a Google calendar reminder. An example could be you remind yourself to take out the trash on trash day, but the same thing could be said for a task. So it is confusing between having a reminder and a task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Experience is too disjointed and lacking features depending on where a task was first created: Can't add recurring option to tasks created in a space, can't share a list of tasks without using spaces, can't add subtasks to tasks in a space, and if you make one in a regular list the subtasks can't have separate dates, can't move tasks created in calendar out of the default list, can't filter or group by space, can't move tasks into a space. I'm not even trying to run a business, just a household."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great view"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Extra for nothing. Just use your Google calendar reminders, events etc"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"EDIT*:Sent Feedback also but why not a Task event CREATION DATE? is it not shown for personal Tasks acct users? It may already show Workspace Administered? but not for personal users accts. Is that what the DETAILS/DATE subset is for?if the Task is timestamped upon creation the subset field can be used for links,phone #s,,m due dates etc for follow ups as i use it for. I add the time myself in body of task I created everytime but other than that, the app is good."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"wow I learned this it's a life saver"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It is ready for the tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I really like the app in and of itself. However this app is supposed to replace Google reminders in 2019, but that still hasn't happened."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very convienient and functional not well intergrated with the calander sync with other devices unfortunately"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Great application that helps manage your day"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The app is great! One complaint I have is that when I created events on my calender and gave them a time slot on a particular day, tasks won't show those at all. I'd like those timed events to appear under the to do list in tasks for a particular day. I'll change my rating if this gets added."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Easy to use!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice simple and easy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good app for tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Extremely useful need to work on pop ups a bit too small to notice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Latest version breaks it on lawnchair launcher"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The app is clean and simple but there is no use to it since when you are looking for task management app you want something to look simple with advanced features. This is so limited"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately after recent update. Its not working and saying ""failed to load the widget"". I hope developer will solve the problem."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Great tool but you can't UNDELETE task once deleted,which is annoying when it happens accidentally on your phone while on the move."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Features and notifications alerts aren't that well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No sirve, necesito que me recuerde en la hora que quiero no cuando la aplicación quiera"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Please give an option to rearrange order of List."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Sir, please add feature to take my confirmation before it delete my task from list. By mistake i clicked on my task and it gone from the list. Please add option in setting to ask for my confirmation before deleting from list. Thank you"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Simple and easy to use. My one complaint is that you can't reorder the lists. I'm talking about the list headings. You can't put your lists in a specific order based on how frequently you use them or which should show up first and I would like to see that function added. You can move items up and down within the lists however."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I don't like the interface. I have to click through too many things what about an open book with everything in front with different pages / dates to navigate"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"List not move reminder to task"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Suggestion: The option to customise widget✨"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"not reminding the tasks regularly waste"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"GOOD DEAL 🤝 S FOR ME"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Overall the app is life saver for time based projects. One thing that could be added is setting the priroty for different tasks. showing the priroty with different colours on calender could be a bonus."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Tasks is sort of a bastard son amongst pure-blood Google apps: it came to life accidentally and is consistently neglected."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"If you can add Target 🎯 date and task age it would be more useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Not reliable i have b using it around 2 mo ths and it is just skiping the notfications and when i open app then it gives the notification whats the benefit when you are not getting your notification in time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping track of what needs to be done! I just wish it would connect with Google calendar. The reminder system also leaves much to be desired, I rarely get notifications on what I need to do, much less at good times. I just have to check the app frequently to make sure I'm not forgetting anything. EDIT: New functionality has been added which has made my experience much better! Went from 4 to 5 stars."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"don't have enough features, bad widget, there's no option to alarm, only 2 options on ""Task Settings"", no templates for tasks..."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"How do you sort list order? The newest list I created is all the way at the back, but I'd like it in the front."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Works good. But it does not work with google assistant. It is so convenient to add reminders using google assistant but I manuaaly have to move reminders to tasks as tasks doesn't work with assistant. Please look into this."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Cannot reorganize the lists. Missing such a basic feature"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I love it cause it's free and repeatable but the only 1 concern that. I recommend that each day have a separate time in just 1 task so it wont be bothered to create another task."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it helps me be productive and helps me with not procrastinating 10 out of 10 recommend especially if you ate in school."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"use it every day. always functional which seems like is a rare feature these days."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Hi and"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"There's really no explanation on how to say this, but I think we could definitely get this app running a whole lot better because there would be moments where I could save task but when I saved them I I would try to open the task but I couldn't even get the test done. We can get this fixed right? G"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Better on computer because it will merge onto your calendar and show you daily tasks. On mobile it is separate and repeating tasks are marked as completed (they are completed on computer too even if the next time it repeats is not done they fall of the list- this is OKAY because they stay on the calendar). I can't see my daily tasks on mobile making it useless 😪"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"barebone app. Add, complete, delete and thats it. It offers nothing more for reviewing or archiving or organizing tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Please give the option to permanently PIN the tasks for the day in my notification bar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Extremely useful for tracking goals, making shopping lists, reminding you to do things, and planning out tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Agreed with terms and conditions"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The order of lists doesn't match the one in online interface"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Needs work. Notifications are completely broken. Edit: The app has improved since my last review. Now waiting on Google Assistant integration!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This is badly designed Task Organizer. - No custom duration for Tasks - No labeling for Tasks - No see all Task function - No color coding different Tasks etc. Only thing thats good is its integrated with Google Calendar, even then when there is no Custom duration option we cannot effectively allocate space and time, making it largely useless. VERY BADLY DESIGNED TASK ORGANIZER. Better to find others"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I mean bullet list is good I don't have problem with that but I can't find the time schedule anywhere, I'm sure it was shown as a feature so where is it?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Does what it's supposed to do..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good app for noting down tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple and forward"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This is a wonderful app where you can create daily tasks schedule and tick mark them as they're done, but how do you actually track them? A timesheet system where you can mark both start and end, plus generate stats and reports would be a great integration to have. Is it possible?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's okay, I prefer keep notes."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Not a fan. No search option. If you don't put a date in for the task to be done, it doesn't show up in Google calendar at all. So you can't search in the calendar for it and you have to manually look for it within the app. This becomes difficult when I have 5 different lists with 10-20 things on them. I also don't like that you can't reorganize the list order. Or the items in the list if they aren't dated. I don't want to date some of my stuff but do want to prioritize. Ehhh"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Looks promising but is pretty basic now. needs to have Google Assistant integration and widgets to be a killer app"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app for task management!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Need Redesign ... tasks of Microsoft have a better design"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very detailed once you get ahold of it. Works great in the Google eco system"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This app is amazing, but I just only one thing to say, and I just hope you can consider it. When we create a new task, we can add a subtask but, we can't repeat the task. I want to create a new task and add subtasks, but I also want to repeat it for a week. Please, try to fix this issue."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I'd like that if I touch the widget on android. It would open the app. Please add more support to google assistant. It's not ok to migrate reminders all the time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very helpful app 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Amazing at helping me keep track. I would like to suggest adding a text size customization option for the Widget so I can choose to increase the size of the lists for the purpose of catching my attention better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The things typed last come first which is a big mistake The first thing typed should always be the first thing Newly typed things should come at the bottom"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I wish a little more customization"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Tried to use this to track my birth control. Took it late 2 days in a row because the notifications go away randomly. Horrible app. Why wouldn't I want the notification to stay until I swipe it away?"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I find that it is easy to use, especially when moving from the Gmail to a ""to-do list"" BUT the lack of a ""Search"" option makes it inefficient in the long run. 😕"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"With the recent 2/6/23 update, I can't figure out how to set up new recurring tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"quite useful and easy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is among The few must have apps every time I get a new phone or device this is one of the first apps I download. Several reasons one being the extremely user-friendly interface, the abilities to set reminders virtually any way not like most being limited to reminder choices like ""every month"" The choices are endless, ex: the 3rd Mon of every month for 12 months - if it sounds confusing, it's my inability to accurately describe the many marvelous features each one being extremely useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Before I even closed out filling out first taste it asked me to review it. So it sucks. Maybe next time make it wait an extra half hour before harassing me with that mess."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Love how I can use this via my phone or my desktop and they sync"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This bare-bone task app has an attractive simplicity. I use it it's because of its 1) easy integration with Google Calendar and Gmail 2) capacity to group tasks (by Lists) and to add subtasks to each task 3) due dates integrated with Google Calendar, including the ability to add reminders === CONS: it's Missing the ability to search"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Great design but can't add subtasks to repeating tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I put down who I owe what I need to do and where I need to go and the time and dates.. it really helps me a lot because I don't remember a lot of things so I look at this and see where I'm supposed to go or what I'm supposed to do each day"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like that it automatically updates on all my devices"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like the app! It's simple and convenient. Would request to enable sorting alphabetically, specially the completed tasks. This would avoid the duplication of tasks/items as one would easily be able to scroll and find the previous entries."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A calendar view would be very helpful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It's ok, but a massive weakness is that it has no search function. Very weird given that it is a Google product and search is their ""thing""!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The notifications for tasks are very sporadic. Sometimes I get the notification on time, other times the notification comes 5 to 10 minutes late, and other times I just don't get the notification at all. Makes the app kind of useless."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"This is a really bare bones Todo list app. It is missing a lot of the features you find on other Todo list apps, but I don't think it is intended to compete. What boggles my mind is that it has no integration with Google Assistant. There is no way to create a task from Assistant. It is such an obvious feature expectation that they must have intentionally omitted it... and I can't figure out why. Are they planning on abandoning this? Who knows ."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So incredibly helpful 🥰 thank you"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Add option to move list Horizontally Please consider adding an option to move the lists horizontally. The tasks can be moved vertically as per our liking. But the lists cannot be moved horizontally if this option is added the app would be perfect."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Redundant app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"That's good 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this app and use for literally every kind of task. But I really wish it had the option to colour code the task lists and individual tasks. And a timer to record the time I spent on individual tasks and a weekly or monthly report on where I spent my time."

Also the subtasks lose their hierarchy after getting checked done and unchecked again. I need to manually change them back from task to subtask. Basically doesn't handle the finished tasks well. I need to be able to go back and look at my task history and know when I finished a task and actually if it was on time or finished overdue, etc."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Why isn't this app completely integrated into Google Calendar? I shouldn't have to open a separate app to see my to do list, and then a separate app for the calendar. I want to be able to see both side by side, and to be able to drag and drop my tasks into the calendar. Also I want to be able to color code my tasks, have categories, and a today tab. The indented sub-tasks lose the indent as soon as I sort by date. I can't believe it is so hard to find an all in one Day Planner app !"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"You cannot edit a regular repeating task. You have to delete it and create new one. UI is not user friendly. There is no option to view Past history."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great so far, Love it 👍👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Great app, very easy to use. Although it would have been nicer to separate task by color or a theme that highlights each task background light and dark, because there's no way to see the separation between each task. Another thing is when subtasks are use and it's ordered by dates or by starred recently they don't look anymore like subtask on the screen they look like task."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Decent task app. Need integration with Google Assistant"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helpful!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good 😊"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It serves its purpose as a simple To-do list, with easy maneuverability. Only thing is that I'm honestly unimpressed or perhaps a little disappointed at the design, just suggest that Google should make the app a little more interesting and not so bland, there are other To-Do list apps which hold a more pleasing aesthetic & look, though i still wish to stick to Google."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"For some reason for the past 2 months the app does not send any notifications unless the app is open which completely defeats the purpose of a reminder. Used to be good, now it's awful. Don't know what they did"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The widget is 3x3. Old version had a 3x2 widget and capability to alphabetize tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This is actually a good app. Been using it for weeks now. But I have some suggestions. (1) adding duration for the time of the tasks (2) adding more color options. I don't know about others but I find it annoying that I have the same color for a different task or reminder. (3) giving a monthly / weekly summary of what tasks took most of my time."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"cant rearrange starred tasks, otherwise could be 5 stars."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love this app for my To Do list. I can reprioritize and move tasks by changing date which is easier than moving sorting Keep Notes checklist. I now use this for repeating tasks instead of events on my old Calendar app. I love seeing tasks on the Schedule view in Google Calendar. I never forget a To Do anymore. I can see and edit on any device."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This problem is a little difficult to explain but I'll try. In this situation of picture is worth a thousand words . I believe it's a sort by date issue. Let's say for example I have 10 tasks for Saturday March 4th. It'll list three tasks under Saturday March 4th. Under that, it will list three more tasks under another March 4th. Under that, it'll list four more tasks under March 4th again. So all 10 tasks are listed on under March 4th but three different times."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Learning about the features"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Can't see the dates for each tasks on the widget. You can see dates only when you open the app. Microsoft's To Do app is better."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It is a very simple to-do app for day-to-day tasks. It lacks some features for me like: 1. You can't hide the subtasks in the app unlike the desktop version, so it is always a long list with tasks and subtasks which makes it uncomfortable to search for a certain task (especially if you have many). 2. No search function. You can't search for a certain task unlike, again, the desktop version. 3. Tasks with subtasks cannot be repeated. Overall, a good minimalistic app for personal use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Please add task list sharing option"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good app 👍👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good really handy in all times but I think it could be better if you can add the property of search between your tasks because sometimes you have too many tasks and you need to scroll till you find the right one"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The ability to make a recurring task was removed in the last update. Notifications for scheduled reminders randomly disappear, making it somewhat useless for its intended purpose. Please fix these!"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Still not sure of this one. When using the app to setup a task, there is no way to setup a recurring task; this can only be done in the Calendar, which makes no sense. Also, you cannot easily change recurring tasks once created, and again have to use the Calendar to do this. There is no way to cancel adding a task, you have to save and then delete, which is dumb. Definitely not a replacement for reminders."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Would love a companion app for Wear OS"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The app Undo the new changes I make to my daily tasks like change in Task Title or adding new Details to it. It saves at the time when I chage it but reverts back to old copy the next day, I have tried multiple times in last few days. All my updated changes to my tasks get lost because of this. What kind of dumb behaviour is this by the app, looks like a huge server bug. Didn't expect this from a Google product. 😡"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Utter garbage. Keep and Calendar are far superior solutions. This is trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist. Stop it Google."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is fantastic."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"There's no reminder. I set up tasks, it's simple, but app doesn't remind me anything. So what's the point."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice UI and useful sync"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I have been tryin to use this app. I set it up "" I THINK"" it deleted the reminders i had on set on my calendar. I dont know where they went. I am not getting any reminders or alarms or anythig like i was able to with just my calendar. I will try again but for now a 3."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"spacing between 2 tasks are double. which gives very very bad UI. There should be an option to reducing spacing between 2 tasks Compact like in Gmail app. This makes task app is unusable."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It is a magnificent tool. It would be nice that it had a search function."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"once again google is trashing something useful (reminders) to push everyone into using the much much worse replacement"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Removing reminders for this? I am not going to ask the assistant to set a task. Why do you keep killing apps and functions we like and rebranding all the time? People stay with Apple because they know Face time and I message will still exist in 6 months."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"No alarm features and also reminder repeat features, suppose if some one by mistake forget to see reminder there should be option to set reminder like alram every ten minutes 3 times like i set 11 am this should again alert 11.10 am if i mark task done alarm will stop Also priorty which user can configure mannualy like high will arlm 5 time , mid 3 and low 1 time. It will very helpful for daily office working employees Also voice assistant who note task by speak make this very usefull."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great way to set and track goals."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it brings great assistance and simple to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Some tasks which I'm created through Google Calendar was not showing, which is annoying please fixed the bug."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Maybe you can add countdown."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like its simplicity in use, and the ability to merge tasks with the calendar, but I noticed that certain tasks, particularly those I set to repeat will disappear, and leave me unable to check them as compete. Individual tasks disappear from Tasks, but come up on Calendar, but I am unable to mark them as compete."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Individual review result Simply create any task an subtask.

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not sure of the point of Tasks to add reminders if it never sends you a reminder until 2 days it's overdue. At this point using a calendar, or setting an alarm would be better than using Tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps me be organized!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Widget problem when phone switches to dark mode automatically."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I also have another app because - 1. Even though the app language is English, I can write in Hebrew from right to left. 2. I can add checklist to a task. * In my older phone: The Samsung Galaxy Note10 Lite, the notification sound doesn't work"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Used to be a very good app, now I'm unable to create new daily tasks, made the UI difficult to find stuff"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Looks like they just got rid of recurring tasks. No way to add them but I can view and edit existing ones"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it does not integrate well with Google Taskboard and Calendar. The subtasks, links and attached pictures do not show."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Repeat occurrence feature to attribute to a specific task has been suddenly removed making it a useless app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Since the recent update, I no longer seem to have the facility to set tasks to repeat; can you help, please?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"can be more eveolved"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is very useful and the user interface is designed well to give the user the most flexibility"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"i can't do repetition on task, after the update this feature is broken"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Makes daily life very much easy."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"You can't reorder your lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it's a task list on my phone. no frills"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Hei, anda merupakan aplikasi dari Google. Namun, kenapa widget anda selalu bermasalah? Mulai dari tampilan yang berantakan sampai widget yg tidak mau terbuka ketika memilih akun."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Hi Team, UI prospective app is very good, request you to add a feature, that is, there should be today's list, so if I add a date to any task on that day it should appear understand the list of today's task. Iphone and Samsung devices has already done this in their Reminder app. Request you to add this feature. That day surely I will provide some better rating."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"There is one major problem with this app. It puts the newest task on the top of the list. There is no way to reverse sort the list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Google is not listening. This problem is still not resolved for many months. Can Google please resolve this problem? I am not able to create and add Task to save it. I have sent Feedback about this problem. The problem is still not resolved! Google Task is not working. I can't add a Task and save it. I keep sending repeated messages for help but there is no response from Google to resolve Google Task App problem. Really frustrating! Can anyone know how to contact Google support for a response?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Scrolls or jumps way down screen when editing. I can not find fix."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Was ok but can't do repeating tasks now. Stop breaking stuff!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It's good but I'd like to have to option to auto delete tasks after they're completed."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple. easy to use. works well"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Can’t add recurring task after recent change"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Losing location based reminders sucks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It lacks too many options"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"WHAT happened? An update, now I cannot schedule repeating at all. Task app so incorporated into my daily life and relied on is useless. UPDATE: DUPLICATES DATES AND SEPARATES TASKS FOR THAT DATE. THURSDAY MAY 19 2022 DOES NOT EXIST AND CANNOT BE POPULATED WITH ANY TASK. EVEN IF YOU DISCOVER THIS THERE IS NOT A THING YOU CAN DO. I like much about this app. Its very helpful and the different lists are good too. I would like to suggest a search option and a date created and date completed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Not enough settings to organize and reorder lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works great, does the job"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it does what it says very well. have a good day"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and set tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Exactly what a to do list should be like. And it's free can't go wrong here."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Also cannot change task to a different list without completely deleting the task and recreating it in the different list. Really wish gTasks was still being maintained. Would love to go back to them now!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The kind of sounds you can get lost in,Mimiors"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Changing my review and rating.... Previous version was more beautiful than updated UI."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I am very happy to see a very productive and useful task app...Thank you google"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple design and easily-navigated."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not possible to sort List Tabs or Group them like Chrome Tabs"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It would be great if there were different colours."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Streamlined and useful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Helpful to look at other tools offline if need be"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"great tool in my toolbox 💪🏾"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"This app's UI is very bad. I am not even able to arrange lists as per my choice. I have many lists and there is no option to arrange lists as per my order. I cannot even order some tasks properly. Please update as soon as possible."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great, should be awesome if you can share your task with other people"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Yes! Thanks!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The issue I have is that the widget often gets blank for no reason at all, this is why I removed the one star"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"AS USUAL GOOGLE STUFFS UP EVERYTHING THEY TOUCH, WITH NO QUALITY CONTROL ON.ANYTHING. THIS APPLICATION IS IMPOSSIBLE TO USE, AND STUPID BEYOND BELIEF. THIS REVEIEW IS MY BELIEF ONLY WITHOUT PREJUDICE."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"l set 1 star to every app which forces me to rate it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good, I am using it everyday."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Request two updates 1. My Day feature (just like Microsoft To Do) in order to say what activity to be done today 2. A quick task add flexibility on mobile screen"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice for students"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"1st, Biggest disadvantage, you have to go one by one task to find particular task. Search facility is not available 2nd, No easy way to select date. To select date after 2 years, I have to click 24 times since there is no drop down list to select desired year / month 3rd, No formatting facility 4th, Cannot attach any files"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy and nice to use,I would recomend :)"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love it! Google is my bestie always come with the greats and goods 🤣😂 I cry laughing on day just to prep all of you... 😲 Oh!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I think thank you, I appreciate it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Useful app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It would be the perfect simple, usable todo app, but one feature that is sorely needed are persistent notifications/reminders for uncompleted scheduled tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"New Widget Update 👎 Until now, the widget would display today's tasks with a blue icon beside. It would display overdue tasks with a red icon beside. As of today, every task entry displays with a red icon in the widget. This needs to be reverted! If anything, overdue tasks should be red, today's tasks should be green, and future tasks should be blue. Please adjust this!! Having a red icon beside every item in tasks is taking away from the clarity that different colors provided."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"was great but with last update cannot select a time reminder - only a date."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"needs push notifications and ability to tag persons on Callender"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"5.7 MB app become 41.68 MB after installation.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"You should keep an option just for per day activity by date..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice and useful for me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"You can share a list but only through the web page not the app then if the other person uses the app also it doesn't sync between you. You should just be able to share through the app and then both add delete and check off things on the list. What's the point of a task up if you can't collaborate properly on mobile."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Pretty useful, and easy to use, but I wish I knew more about my tasks in the beginning before I used the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple interface, but effective and reliable performance. It's part of my daily life organising tools now."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Widgets are now half whitespace. There are while lines that only contain an arrow to indicate child items exist but there is nothing after the arrow. Other lines now have too much whitespace between items. Overall the widget now only shows half the items it previously did because of the new spacing. Bring back the more compact view!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Make the Add button center"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Not Very Useful, Lacks a Lot of Important Feature, Microsoft One is Better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great! But lacks some features: I'd really like to have the ability to make tasks/reminders repeat/notify more frequently than just once a day. It's quite important to be reminded several times a day about certain tasks. Notify until completed (nagging feature) would be great too ;)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It was working fine before but now i don't get notifications"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Your latest update on 6 February 2023 is full of bug. Lack of editing option. Repeat time schedule option is missing."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ok it's great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It's almost like a calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Everything is alright."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Decent app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"need some notification tones"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"keeps me on task."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"OK thanks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very simple, easy to use, a good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice and helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The experience is amazing but there's one problem is that every task notification disappears after 1-2 hours after reaching me... Plz fix this issue"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Setup shared tasks list with partner for household tasks. Can't both get the push notifications on shared tasks, only the person who setup the task gets it. Pretty bad functionality"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Search option can make it easier to find tasks for editing."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Says easily sharable. Is very much not won't lete send invite isn't even an option in selecting after you create a list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Missing Essentials like reordering lists, nesting lists, adding tags for tasks, adding photos for tasks and also recognising date and time from text input like Todoist. Most of these features are way overdue. Keep notes and tasks are falling behind iOS notes and reminders in terms of features."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's a bit too simple I wish it had more features"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Wow i was paying for apps that I never new that I had awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Thank You."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"4 star because the task input is still manual unlike ticktick or todoist"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like how we can make tasks out of emails on Gmail, but it doesn't have that feature for mobile."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Dear Google Overall task is nice but you must be given a view where all task or selected list could be seen at once, everytime we have to click each list to see all the task..pls give ""see All task"".. 🙏"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"يستحق التحميل والتجربة"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"why not have intelligent system to detect task name date time from the writing. if someone writes meeting at 2pm today it should automatically set it for today"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Overall I really like this app. It's very helpful when you have ADD. I gave it 4 stars because it doesn't allow me to reorder my sub task without retyping them. (I would also love to add it to my pixel watch.)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I've been using Tasks for a few months now. I'm not sure that it's better or easier to use than setting reminders (I do this through Google Assistant) or even setting it as an event/activity in Calendar. I think this is an app that I'll be deleting before too long."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"the ability to share, sync & use an entire task-list with others would be nice."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"it not the worst thing in the world"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent App, Keeps things remembered for you"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"can we we re sort the task lists. so far far pretty good. I'd like tasks to be able to share certain lists with certain people not ALL my lists . so far decent we will see where upgrades head to or if this app will get better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"'Smooth Operstor'!;)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The widgets don't sync with the app. The problem persists after updates as well. We end up viewing the incorrect info. Please correct soon"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Not too bad until my husband, Ben Olson, hacked my account and stole my life. The app works as long as you can keep it going. Enjoy yourself. Sandra Dee. Her own entity. Earned not bought. Good Bye."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Incredibly helpful app, it's been a powerful tool for getting my life back in order from the ground up after being in a low point in my life. I'll probably be using this app or apps like it for the rest of my life. The UI is minimalistic and generally intuitive. I would love to see better interaction between tasks and subtasks. I couldn't create a set of repeating subtasks listed inside a task for organizational purposes. Thus my task category pages are cluttered to hell. Because of that, 4/5."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A I Love your support 💛"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Update: it looks like my tasks are still recurring, i changed my rating to a 5, since this app helps me so much. Thank you!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"me gusta mucho para recordar los trabajos pendientes"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Organization"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good app. Very simple to use and concise. Useful you can set repeat reminders and categorise them too. Lacks a 'search' feature though which let's the app down. 🖐🏼 FAO: Google developer - I'm wondering if you could add a 'search' feature to this app ?? Thanks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Uses well, not the most innovative to do app I have"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The widget doesn't work anymore, 1 month already..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"not enough function"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good but on multiple occasions my details on tasks have been removed when I return to the app at a later time, so it's very frustrating."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Since the latest update, the banner of the widget is acting weird. Whilst the main body of the widget follows the system's dark theme, the banner remains white no matter what. And the font stays grey instead of black... It was fine before the update"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Cannot collapse tasks, so subtasks are always visible."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Extremely buggy. When sorting by date, some dates appear twice. Some tasks appear on the wrong date. Some don't even appear. I cleared my cache and the bug persists."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great 👌🏻"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Cannot copy, import, or export."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Useful for an old man who forgets things."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Better than other task minders that were too complicated and required more time. Very straight-forward, intuitive."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Whenever you can, please add a priority setting for the individual tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great App! Syncs well with Google Calendar and Gmail."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Quite useful. it would be great if a scale of priority would be included."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Para tener 5 estrellas le falta q pueda darle formato en la descripcion, armar listas, poner en negrita, etc. Mismo problema en google calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great tasks app but no collaboration"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"does what it's supposed to."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"No way to share tasks and collaborate."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I will not say 1 but more."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Clear"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I use it all the time. For homework tasks, I will write in what I need to do before end of day. Grocery lists, packing for a trip, list of things to get done. I wish there was an associated watch app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Recurring tasks has been removed!! Why??"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"this is a great app although I hope you all are programming this for every app such as the phone, contact, notes, Google drive and be able to share it and add to the task list with the ability to edit or assignment"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Easy & Simple. Wish it had an option for an alarm as an option."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I need a way to have text reminder and able to load image, website reference"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Would be great if it had the ability to print a task list! It says it can!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Hi, I accidentally deleted some bunch of Task that I created. Can you help to restore that."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"not as good as I thought it would be. Rather disappointing... missing a lot of useful functions."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So I've been using this app for few months now and everything was nice until the recent update where the features for reminding daily weekly was removed. Can you please bring this feature back?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"神"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"This app needs a search function, and the ability to access a task that has been deleted by mistake (besides the undo function that only lasts a few seconds)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Perfect in its simplicity! I was using Google Calendar to add tasks and then deleting them one by one as I finished them so I could better see everything else on my calendar. I had no idea this app existed until today and WOW it makes keeping tasks organized even easier! It's such a simple app yet it has everything I could think or need.. sorting, starring, setting a date and time, bulk deleting old tasks. Thank you, Google!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I use this app often, but it's disappointing that an app made by Google doesn't even support Material You. The widget is not very good. I setup a lot of subtasks and I can't view them on the widget."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I think plan your day before starting it make us confident and excited to starting a new journey. Google task is something better than to do list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Post Traumatic Brain Injury this app helps tremendously!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"yes it lags"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The detail part of a task should let you attach files or photos though"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Using this add on helps me because I no longer have to create a recurring appointment for tasks I need to complete and attire it in calendar. With this app, it is simple to create the recurring talks that show up a different color within calendar, remind me when they are due, and keeps them in a separate list for review."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Occasionally loses data due to a syncing issue - but I think the solution is to make sure that you hit the back arrow to save your task after you're done editing it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"3rd party ones better, banned by google"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I just got this Google Task, I don't know to much about it and I gave a five star. I have an old phone that gets information from my new phone for signing in I don't know how long this phone will last because it's not with a company like ATandT. What will I do if this phone quits working?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Won't work, constantly loading even after app update"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"A good, minimalist tasks app. Whilst I appreciate the desire to keep things simple, there are some serious omissions. For example, you cannot reorder task lists. Nested tasks behave in strange ways - I don't see why this functionality shouldn't be the same as it is in Keep. The recent update added the ability to sort tasks and rename lists, but it's crazy to me how this app has been around so long without such essentials, especially considering the recent push away from Keep."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple and clean, great to-do app. can't beat google"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very simple application for a task list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Why not use this? It's so easy."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The missing star is because it still bugs out at time especially when offline"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Quirky. Not top noch where you'd really love it but more like you have to make it work. Can't search uless you date & have on Google calendar - the you have to search in Google Calendar."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Quick spot to log to-do items"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Absolutely no sound/alarm options"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"A near perfect app. Being able to assign a date and time to subtasks should make the app more task-specific, and this, I think, will improve user productivity."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The app feels very basic, but works fine due to integration with Google products"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"One star off, because no way to show all lists in same view. Especially in the widget."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"provide option to show pending tasks in notification are"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Don't work without gmail and offline"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great 👌👌"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Needs to allow sharing lists with other Google Tasks users. I like the simplicity. This is a great way to keep track of tasks in your personal life. It integrates well with the calendar, setting times and due dates is simple. The only thing it lacks is the ability to share a list with a specific family member or friend. For married couples, this would be especially useful and a wonderful addition to the Google tool suite. If tasks allowed sharing of lists the rating would have been five stars."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Can't get them to copararate with laws and can rewrite rule as they please"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"doesn't integrate with Google assistant it seems?"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy to work and to settle priorities"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Love how simple it is, but can you please add a manual option to reordering? I have multiple lists for businesses, personal, etc and would love to be able to Star the things from each list that I need to do today and then be able to manually reorganize my Star list to plan my day. Currently I can only sort by ""Starred recently"" or ""date."" Starred Recently kinda works but I'm a visual person and it's hard to juggle 12 items spread across 5 lists in my head to then try and Star in reverse order.."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Simple and clean app, i love it. But sometimes it's annoying that you can't sort your lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This program does everything I needed it to do on mobile, but I think the lack of wearOS integration is a huge oversight because I'd love to use this on my Pixel Watch. It feels like Google forgot about this app in favor of Google Keep sadly."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"useful app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app, fast and smooth, much better than Microsoft to do app, while they do have some more features, but this is more convenient for me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"pretty good. wish I can share lists with others though so teaming is easier"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Application is great but please add few Features 1:-Recycle Bin for Tasks 2:-If we delete a task with sub category it creates mess and divide into many tasks 3:-Add Day Created or Day Completed for tasks"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"well structured"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Does not support tags, nor does it allow addition of files. Doesn't support DAV."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy. There's not much to say. It gets the job done."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I don't know why I can't have a task with sub tasks be set to repeat daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly, but it's a 1 star until something as simple as that is added."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No WebDAV, therefore pointless app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The only improvement that comes to mind is a way to use a numeric priority to order the list by. Implementing that could be tricky, but I can think of a couple of ways it could be accomplished."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The app is really hard to use on the Pixel 7. The phone is way too big and need to use to hands to do most everything in the voice app sucks so you have to type everything."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"i liked it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Too early to comment."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"App is good, lightweight and easy to use. But the most important and missing functionality is to have a search bar to search the already created tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"You have to push another button to set a due date instead of the editing menu popping up. When editing the task the button at the bottom isn't save, it's mark task completed. Bro, I'm editing the task, it's not completed. There's no search. Worst of all, it's buggy as hell. Half the time when I put subtasks in, they don't stay nested to the main task. If I un/reinstall, that fixes it. But it's happened 7 times and I can't keep uninstalling and reinstalling an app for basic functionality."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple and effective. Keep the widget on the home screen and it'll do it's job, and so will you."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It is nice for most things but I wish it had the ability to share select lists with other people."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I don't use tools like this, but ad organized as I am and older I tend to forget everything 😅 so glad has help so far."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Learning curve but fantastic"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's easy to use. I like the App theme also."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's missing a lot of the features that some of the other task managers have, but actually the simplicity is nice. Does exactly what it needs to, no more and no less."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"unacceptable condition! my phone always in dark mode, the problem with widget! the text color is grey! (name of the list) please fix this"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Just wish it was Available on wear OS, instead of Keep which is twice as hard to navigate."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"could be better if there was a web app or desktop app instead of integration with Google calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app. keeps me on time with tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Clutch!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Write meaningful patch notes"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Recurring tasks marked complete do not show next instance of task. This is really annoying and makes it near impossible to plan ahead."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app. Does exactly what you think it would do. I would add the ability to have tasks/reminders pop up by location. For example I want it to remind me to call someone when I arrive at (this location)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"User for long time from multiple device"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"integrated very handily with Google Calendar and Gmail, if you use them"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Lack of sharing, ability to add files (e.g. photos) hold this back from being more useful. Feels like it overlaps with Google Keep, and Google Keep is more useful to me. Annoyingly, Google calendar integrates primarily with Tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very simple use. Should have better display options"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"if you could easily share this with others this would be 5/5"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app! Super useful, but an improvement could be made. I'd like to rearrange my list categories. Some I only thought of later but I use much more than others. Thanks!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"one thing is Miss and I think that is weekly or monthly goals recorded with and doing percentage."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Been looking for something like this to straighten my life out"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"What's the point of a reminder that doesn't remind you after a few initial reminders?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Spectacular"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Basic simple and straightforward. Not clear if the standalone version is working or not, but the Gmail integration and Android for mobile phone use is great."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So far loves the way it syncs with Google calendar and can be categorized, but I wished it can sync with other mail like Hotmail."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great for da ☁️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Being Google it syncs with calendar but honestly otherwise very basic. I'm disappointed given how clever some Google products are, this feels overlooked. No charm and no ingenuity. Some bugs re subtasks which seems pretty fundamental, I'm working around it for now (well just not bothering with subtasks) but hoping this'll get upgraded."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A Google calendar reminder with a little bit more features. It works for me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Would like to be able to share without an outside app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"sweet"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Brilliant"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"App sux"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I would use your app but I have read 20+ reviews everybody is basically saying the same thing! What happened to you google?!? You used to listen to your customers & take into account what they are asking for and fix it. This could be a really great app if you would just listen to what everybody has sd add some or all of the features. Some are still updating their reviews years later w/ the same complaints but you don't even comment back or engage w/ any of your reviewers & that's sad!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Please add file attachments option🥺🤍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Keeps me updated at the right time, discreetly or loud, I love you google 🤗"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Just got it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Getting better with every release but still missing some key features. Update: Still waiting on better view options and filtering. 😕 Downgrade to 3 stars. GOOG."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"very limited in functionality and won't stop asking for a review while using it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"needs to sync with Google assistant"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app. That will be nice to get calendar starting on Monday please ! Also, the widget to create a new task does not have an icon..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Is there an option to change the widget to dark mode?"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"amazing and quick"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps me keep everything in order and get things done!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app. Please include attachment feature like in calendar also in sub-task and task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I think it's up to anyone to better yourself in the long run I'm tired military memory loss you short term memory lost Maybe because i don't want to remember half of the stuff that went over sea I was there When they had that movie called the BLOOD DIAMOND people seemed to think if it wasn't for us there would not be the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND ALL THAT GOOD STUFF DON'T BE A CORN DOG IT'S NOT GOING TO GET BETTER I LOVE JESUS YES. USA ALL THE WAY"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"A good basic task list app. Two features I would really like: the ability to easily collapse subtasks, and to share a list with someone."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very beautiful very easy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Poor"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Works well but it's impossible to create alerts, something that pierce through the mobile for your attention. With the existing notifications you basically know a task is overdue only when you look for it. What a pity, otherwise would be a really top app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"notification board should be add"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Es lo que se necesita para ordenar tareas y subtareas, tremenda herramienta. Sin embargo, encuentro pésimo que para las subtareas, al momento de marcar como completadas se desplacen como completadas generales y no se mantengan como completadas dentro de la misma tarea como subtarea completada"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps me a lot 😉"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great for productive."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent to do app.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"mie personal imi e util."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I am getting so much done! Who care if the occasional task appears that I didn't create tells me to go buy Google products?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Does exactly what I want."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app. it definitely keeps me organized and things in order that needs to get done throughout the day."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Pretty great app but I do think it is lacking in some ways in terms of ability to view tasks on a web browser (via computer) but it syncs well and is a great efficient tool"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"New but like it so far"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"App Is great. If you can add colors for different task it will be amazing..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works great so far"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very useful when traveling and exam etc"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Viber"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Best tasking app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Easy to use and good integration with gmail and calendar. The widget looks good and is easy to use with both scrolling switching task list. I really wish that the widget could be made smaller as task lists don't need to be so wide. Also more customisable with things like transparency and font."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Splendid"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Great for simple lists. Please add a way to drag and sort my lists anyway I want. Not for more complex scheduling or checklists. You need a more dedicated app for that."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Why would I need it when you can do the same with your calendar app?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"On the whole, a great app. Only 2 things would make it perfect: an option for searching tasks and a few more widgets."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"They're not the recliners I wanted, but they're the recliners I got. 😏"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I'll begin from a disadvantage. Firstly, this app lacks a audio feedback when you complete a task. And me as a Microsoft ToDo user can't use this app without this. Bu this is a very good and handly app. And I would like to you add this feature in the future."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it made me make sure that I complete all my daily tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very good app, thank you. I noticed one uncomfortable thing from my point of view. I have a lot of repeated tasks, some of them everyday tasks. If today I marked repeated task as completed, this task is not displayed for tomorrow. It does not give an opportunity to estimate the next day's load. In my opinion, it would be better if all tasks were visible."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ease of use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Very usefull task reminder, but can we have more colors please, since it is an app that helps us to be productive."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Horrible. No collaboration. No sub-items. No functions. Someone spent 20 minutes on design and an hour coding"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"after the redesign, safe to say it's much better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"LIKE IT! 🙂"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"If the widget didn't create a new app when adding a task, that would be great😭"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great little tool for the day to day stuff"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Works sporadically in the browser"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"can't get my work schedule to post to calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is great as is. but Google, Please listen. 1) Do not give up on this app. 2) Keep improving it so it can compete with the best paid task apps on the app store 3) Keep it completely free. My personal information should be payment enough. Thank You."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Really love using Google Tasks app. Simple. Smooth. Just a few suggestions for now that I think would be helpful for users: 1. Change the order of lists and arrange them (not just show according to the time they were created). 2. ""All Tasks"" view where all tasks would be shown in one list 3. Sort tasks according to due date with descending and ascending order. 4. Sub-tasks to be always connected to main task (sub-tasks separate from main task when tasks are sorted by due date) Thanks!"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Tasks won't stay organized - What happened? This app is a life saver for me until recently. Now, I organize my list on my Gmail side tab. But then I check it with my phone and everything is out of order? Why? What changed???"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I wish you'd add my today section or a specialized section that shows you all the tasks that are due"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's so amazing. The only downside for me is that it doesn't have all the List Overview and Statics. If only that was there, no one could beat this"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Unable to see completed tasks in calendar view."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Always Cool"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Useful App"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"needs better UI/UX. A separator line between tasks will be good."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Getting better. Please simplify the widget and add a Focus smart list containing both starred tasks and those due within 7 days. Thank you."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"can not shuffle important task otherwise very good👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"😂😂😂 it was better when this option was in google calander. it's strange to find out it as an another app fr 😂 lol"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Nothing of importance"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"helpful!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Another good one by Google"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"This app could still use some work. moving an email task because of accidently putting in the wrong colum in the beginning and trying to move it to the correct one ( which at times it does ) but when moved it creates the same task again. Until you mark the task as done then it disappears. The app works. But could use some work though. I believe it's an actual ""Task"" app of possible daily reminders or weekly. But the on line add in Google said it was a Gmail task app helper."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Can't give a fair review"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and elegant way to have a helpful list. I use it daily as a mental dump space to return to later. I especially love the widget for Android phones so I can use this without ever opening the app! Extremely helpful!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice and easy to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Notification doesn't pop up if you missed a task. Has been like this for some time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I wish I could resort and the interface was more friendly - I would like to add checkboxes without saving and closing then reopening. I've found Mac's notes handier for making my to-do lists (except for the sharing with non-Apple-ists)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it would be better if reminders from Keep and Calendar were integrated to Tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Usefull app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"You would think an app designed to manage tasks would be able to sensibly handle recurring tasks. I didn't believe the other one star reviews before I downloaded it, but now I find myself writing a one star review of my own. It's become a Google standard: release a product with some bugs, ignore user feedback until people stop using the product, cancel support for the product citing lack of users."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best 👍🏾"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app but if I get a notification until the task is completed, that's great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app of all time Pls can the developers work on the notification settings. At least we should be able to change the notification settings for the task. At times we hardly noticed that we have a new task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I would give this 5 stars if I can add this to my Google Home hub and Google Pixel watch. It's a good task manager but I wish it was included with Google Home."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Everything is fine but the only thing which I see as a disadvantage is I can't set priorities to the tasks like setting a color to particular task widget or at the border of checkbox I hope this feature will be added in the near future."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Nothing new ok, the reminder alarm cannot be set."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app and great features if I only remember to use it it's quite effective unlink to my Google account it's very convenient...."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I love the tasks in my own realm but some tasks that repeat my wife and I need to be on board so this really isn't option. Please fix. Ideally I'd want tasks to repeat and my wife and I can see what needs doing and check off that it's done for both to see. Instead of one set up I have to assign a task when it's really both of our task"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It would be useful if I could share tasks with other users, so I could for example manage household chores. If I could share tasks, then I could add a household task and it would appear on my gfs task list also, so either of us could mark the task complete."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very helpful and easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"WORST THAN GOOGLE CALENDER!!! NO REMINDERS WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works great!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"the tasks never pop-up in my notifications bar until after I open the app, which is also well past the time when they should appear. Even though I have it set to daily and weekly"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I love this product I can see google developing it more so I can use this instead of other task apps like monday trello asana and so on. whenever I have the chance to keep everything in the google family I prefer that its the cleanest and most comfortable to have all these different needs met in 1 place. at this point of development I just really wish there were lists I could share with other google task users. thnx"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"A very helpful app for when I'm wondering if I've done a thing today. Especially when doing said thing twice could cause liver failure. I recently noticed subtask is a thing and now I'm wondering why they are removed when the task repeats... Can that be changed? Would help for organization. One task for eating today, one task for bed time, one task for each the exercises as opposed to the 4 different lists I need to keep my page clean. I'd be cool if I could monitor the history or link calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Please add voice typing function on home screen of the app, for adding a task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very simple layout. Had a smidge of a problem with the comparability of Tasks and Calendar but it worked itself out. Good app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great, simple app for task management"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very good reminder app. Simple, clean, no ads, no payments, ease of use, everything. I got very excited when I found out you can use a widget on your home screen, but upon setting it up I found out there was a 50/50 chance when changing between tasks that it repeatedly opens and closes the menu, effectively giving me and my phone a seizure. Still a very good app though."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"doesn't seem integrated into the android software. if I tell the phone add something to the shopping list it's a separate list than this. does merge with the calendar app though"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"its good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very helpful and my previous feedback was taken into account, thank you! however one more request if its possible: for repeating tasks every x number of days, itd be super helpful if the task reset to x days from the completion date rather than x days from the initial due date, if that makes sense. ie. if i set a task for every 15 days but dont do the task for 5 days, currently the gap between tasks is only 10 days rather than 15 when it resets. i hope that makes sense, thank you!"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"When is the google assistant integration coming for google tasks? This was announced back in september, what is the timeline? Its kind of jarring having all my google reminders converted to be tasks, but when asking my google home's to ""remind me to....."" it creates a reminder instead of a task still."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Pathetic app. You can't even change the start of the week, nor change the order of the lists."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Much improved from when I tried it a few years ago."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Amazing! All my Google tasks in 1 place, it even syncs up to my Google calendar. Only thing that would be cool is if I could share certain lists with other people's Google accounts"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it's missing the option to reorganise and priorities the tasks, but overall I enjoy it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"just learning the app now. rate it later.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great for syncing up chores across devices. Dark theme almost works now. Still missing title of widget. Lacks ability to switch between accounts on the widget dropdown (as opposed to only being able to switch between lists on a specific, pre selected account on a per widget basis). Would also like to have the option of completed tasks instantly respawning for their next recurrence instead of having to wait, this would allow marking the next occurrence as complete."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it was so helpful especially the synchronization with the other Google apps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Simple, effective, and reliable. Only things I'd like to see is more integration with other Google services, searching, and a ""My Day"" feature."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"App is very useful but lacks basic features such as search."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"No collaboration or sharing features. Redundant and incompatible with other Google products (like Keep, Shopping List, and Assistant). The UI and widget are pretty nice at least."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This is nothing but a con to get you to buy the paid version. It deletes you todo lists then tells you you have to buy the paid version or actually program the stupid app to undelete your list. Total BS if you ask me! I'M NOT IMPRESSED GOOGLE! 🤬"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like the simplicity yet loaded with functionalities. In sorting however, new tasks should go below existing tasks not at the top. We start to write the most important tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I soooo much wished that I could schedule repetitive tasks like ""every day"" or ""every 3rd day"" but only for weekdays. Also, I often happen to save single-shot tasks wrongly in the Repetitive list, and repetitive tasks in the Single-shot list. I really wished the app grouped them automatically in such lists"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like the simplicity in using this app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Cool app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nica app to keep track of lists and reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love it!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Greatly improved since I last used it. But: 1) Notifications don't persist across reboots 2) Can't move repeating tasks to a different list 3) Subtasks show up as stand-alone tasks in the list...🤷🏾‍♂️ 4) No search facility... Really???"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"seems easy so far"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app to track to do list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please add some features like 4D praority tables.That helps to do take main inportants from the to do list. So that we can divide our works in prority wise like A B C D"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps me organise"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Helps me stay organized"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It is not sending reminder notification. Using Samsung A52s."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Won't even let me move a task from one list to another. Absolute garbage. Crazy that a post it note can do the job better than 30+ years of technology."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good app,"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I can either add sub-tasks or repeat a task, but not both. Weird. Also, there are sync issues. Some updates/changes don't get synced and were missed. I had to update those tasks twice or thrice. Let's just hope Google doesn't kill it, and actually develops it into a complete tool."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"if possible it would be nice to upload download PDF jpeg or other files"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"perfect"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Useful enough, but if I swipe away a notification and don't use the app for a while, it stops giving me notifications. As much as I get phones try to optimize battery and space, I could really use an app that just keeps giving me the reminder no matter what. Might be an issue with Samsung phone as well, since it worked fine on my older Motorola phone"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Fab"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love this app great for storing notes to later reference and keeping task easily at hand"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Repeating tasks won't show up in your task list until the day they are due. Otherwise, they're in the ""completed"" section. I need a little more forewarning than the day of, Google. Makes the app completely unusable for anyone that has repeating tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great little app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"🌅"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"""Tasks"" is a helpful app to accompany Google Calendar. Quickly move info from emails to Tasks for easier convenience."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"If this is going to replace reminders, then it needs to be really easy to add a task through Google Assistant."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"sometimes it misses notifications which is its only job"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"This is an amazing app but you have to add options in settings where the option of tasks show on the notification bar and also mark them on notification menu. Thank you!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love love this app. 🫶. thank you for creating it 😊"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It would be the best if the remaining tasks are shown in notification permanently until completion"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Does exactly as advertised."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"best app to do the works and to be on track"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good enough to keep track of stuff to do, more customizable options would come in handy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Gets the job done, so to speak. Offers very little in the way of customization. I wish you could assign a completion % for larger tasks. You can set a due date for a task but not a start date. It'd be nice to offer some view options for your list, such as color coding, font size, etc."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Unintuitive functionality."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good,but why is there reminders and tasks !? ... isn't the same thing here online ?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I have subscribed to the Google Family sharing features. We are able to share the Google Calendar but we couldn't share Google Tasks. And funny thing is Google Community advising a third party TasksBoard app to do this job. Kindly incorporate the sharing features in Google Share."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great for keeping on top of things"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Perfeito e limpo, o melhor de todos!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"me like"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Fine so far. I just have a very low threshold for Ads. I'd like to look up topics on Myself and use information from Google Search which works Excellent ❣️✌️🥰"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This is very good app, It would have been a lot easier to have a system where I could read when I added tasks, and when I completed them."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app but very minimal on features though. Really need the ability to set a time for a whole category rather than needing to do it for every task individually. Color coding would be greatly appreciated. And the ability to choose what lists go onto your Google calendar rather than the all or nothing."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Spirit confirmation #"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Clean, simple, effective. Very nice! One thing. Please just make the new tasks added to the list push in from the bottom not the top because most often I usually add the most important & prominent things first, then the trivial things last. Hence in the app (currently) the trivial stuff will be shown first. Thanks guys! I look forward to seeing this in a future update! Because unlike the bad apples Google & Android actually listen to thier customers."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent app for time management"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It needs SNOOZE. I set reminder times, but if I can't get to a task right then I want to Snooze it, not just ignore the notification. An ignored notification is a forgotten notification."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app, as simple as it is, has been a life saving game changer. I cannot believe I never utilized a similar app but since I'm a Google & Pixel kinda guy, Tasks was going to be it when I did. So easy and simple to use yet nearly essential to my way of life now. I load it up with even the most mundane things but keeping on top of it all has increased my productivity and improved life at home. GET THIS APP."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good interface integration, simple to use."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's a good app. I love its integration with Google calendar. But Google, please make an option of search in it and also repetitive task don't show until the date its due. Microsoft todo is way better in these, i don't use microsoft because they don't allow integration with google calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice. Need option to change the order of lists. Very important lists, which are created last, are only available in the last raw."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The repeating task always change the order. I put it back every and they still change the order every day. even tried deleting all and rewrite them all in order but they still keep changing order . very annoying. And the widgets are slso little buggy"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helpful in keeping my to do list down."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"this is a good app for tracking tasks. however an improved integration with Gmail would make it a great app. I would like the app to link the email when creating a task from gmail"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Best Tasks app. Would be great though to have a button for tasks not completed. Also a month's review for percentage of tasks completed out of all the tasks set. Plus a percentage for tasks completed on time."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please add a search function"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"repeated tasks don't work"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I just started using this app but it is REALLY helping me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"A very vital tool that is somewhat annoying to use sync'd to Gmail, especially on Android. The setting to add an email to a task is not intuitively located so requires searching each time. Then, I have to hit the ""view"" button to add a due date. Otherwise, it's like you have a to do list hidden under a pile of paperwork, it never gets looked at. The default for adding any task should be to take you into the date/time selection feature."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Bare minimum care and effort was put into this app. It is begging you not to use it. 2 stars as it is not brkoen."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"the recurring tasks won't show up again when it need to happen."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Changing my review from 5 to 3 stars. Lately the app no longer sends push notifications unless I actually open up the app. I have all of my settings on to allow push notifications. This makes the app pretty useless if I have to remember to go into the app to check what my reminders are.. hopefully this gets fixed because it was a lifesaver before."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Can't edit tasks once created, and the widget doesn't show the information with the title. Basically useless.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"App Works Well For Reminders & Scheduling Appointments‼️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"For now, I'll give it 2 stars. The fact that there's not a Galaxy 5 watch companion is surprising and for many of the same reasons others are not happy with it. Not being able to use GA to add to a specific list is a flaw."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Easy to Use Clean UI, does exactly what you need. Only thing I wish it did was allow me to go right into the next task without resetting the keyboard to closed and having to hit the ""+"" button again, it would streamline adding multiple tasks after the other."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice task manager, I like it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very simple and powerful app, like for this, just separate on 3 lists. like important/urgent, important/not urgent, not important/not urgent. Resolve all my task issues"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Useless solution for real life. Cannot online share subtask list or all list with other. As example, parents can not share and work together a shopping list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"op bolte"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"good work schedule planner"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Everything is okay, I like this app. But I have one problem with widjets: widjets's text have faded color and widjets always grey, no matter what theme you have in app. It is inconvenient to look at the widget due to the color. Not sure how to regulate it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Can you keep the subtasks under the primary task even after they're completed? Once you mark them complete, they separate from the task so if you were to undo a subtask becomes a primary task. I like seeing the subtask crossed out under the main task to show progress and history rather than have it disappear into the completed tasks section."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it's a very weak alternative to Trello."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Useful for organizing daily ToDo tasks"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"exelente aplicación para darle seguimiento a las actividades que se tienen que completar en el día"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Interesting application"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Is it just me...am I completely tech illiterate...am I blind...or am I just plain down looney but...is it not possible to share a task with another Google Tasks user...? I can't find a share button anywhere. I mean...what...did I wake up this morning and mistakenly assume that I was still living in the 3rd millennium and had not been timeported to the stone age...? I'm gobsmacked. Is this some NSA protocol, or...? Please explain, Google. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Love it! No problem using it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Pretty good for keeping track of tasks but it would be nice if it could be better integrated with Google assistant as I find tasks to be a lot more helpful than reminders"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not able to recover a task list, which is accidentally deleted. There is no undo or trash bin for that. This is very worst. I lost an entire task list, which i have to put them all again. Really a long work."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I 100% recommend this app! This app is for people who desire to complete their goals."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"really a lot of potential here. it's a very simple app and does what it's supposed to, but it needs some more user control and features."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Hi. We can't search in the tasks. Please put the search option into this app. Thanks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I use this app to schedule all the rhythm of life tasks, paying rent, changing filters, giving meds to pets, etc. Works great to offload some mental capacity and keep me on track."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"perfect checklist! thank you Google!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Don't recall using it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I like the simplicity of the UI, but the workflow for creating recurring tasks doesn't work with subtasks. Without that ability, Microsoft's To Do app wins for planning routines/habit stacks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not getting notifications"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple but useful until you are not using tags"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app reminds me what I need to do to get things done in my life 😁"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very useful but wonder why there is no feature of customize to do list that should be unchecked next day in order to mark check after tasks done. I completed tasks and checked all, the next day I want to check again tasks but the problem is that we have to make to do list again."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Hey there , Is there a way to add subtask and at the same time repeating the alarm I cannot able to do both at the same time If possible please give an idea Or else add this option in the future Regards Afrath"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good! But could be better. I love the flexible options of repeating items, but here are a few things I think would make it really useful full fledged task management app: 1. Provide an ""All Tasks"" category that would show my upcoming tasks in all of my lists. Starring the tasks to do this is just painful 2. Allow us to change the list after a task is created. 3. When snoozing a task in the notification, sync the snooze to all devices with Tasks installed so that the task shows everywhere."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Would have been a 5 star but i want to be able to share task with my team right from the app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome works the best. But do want to see some options. Like Moving, Tasks from one list to another easier, may be an option for that and Tags feature."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"does what I need it 4"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I love this app, it's my go-to everyday, but I hope it's in the pipeline to find a way to Archive the Lists instead of the option to ""Delete List"" and ""Delete all completed tasks"". I don't want to delete, I want to archive. At this point, it's just sitting there as a dead list, staring at me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app helps in my every day activities 😌"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Great app, I use it a lot. Its disadvantage is the lack of many features such as searching by words, dates and tasks. It also does not integrate well with Google Apps. I suggest adding pictures and comments on them, and merging tasks and alerts into the diaries"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Hi Google, I wanted to send feedback about the Google Task widget. First of all I want to say that I really like Google Task because it really helps me in working and synchronizing between devices and desktops. But for widgets on Android, especially the Galaxy M23 that I use. Can you provide an update so that the size of the widget on the homescreen can be 2x2, not only 3x2. Thank you very much."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good and convenient experience"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Missing search and dark mode widget. Bug: Subtasks get added as a no date task. If you complete the no date task it removes the subtask. White background widgets tear my eyes out at night. I use GTasks which supports both search and dark mode. It's also more efficient with displaying a list in the widget. In the same space I can get 10 items with gtasks and only 7 with the Google tasks. Unfortunately now that Google is finally updating tasks, gtasks is not syncing everything."

Marking 4* instead of 5* bc: The flexibility of repeat tasks is great, but it would be great if you could move them to a different list once you've created them. Tasks show up as a single filter in google Calendar, but it would be very nice to have the option to use the lists from the task app as separate calendar filters so that they can be assigned different colours."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Very simplistic and useless. There are better apps doing much more. I am unable to share lists with my family or team. Unable to tag or categorize. Good for basic lost only with few items."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Wish i could make more categories.. share tasks with others.. add images.. I decreased rating to 3 stars.. Long time no updates.. Lack of basic features much tasks app have.. That wasn't expected from a Google app.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"5 star rating."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please give feature of putting a days' to do list on home screen like a widget"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this. Between this and the assistant I don't for things anymore. perfect flowing system."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Not shore"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Really needs a search facility to find tasks. Otherwise excellent. Works offline too."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"cool app, I wish Google to buy it and make all options for free ;-) but even a free version is useful and helpful. thanks 🙏👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Screen is not proper to view , completed tasks shoud be visible on same saceen and also there should be option of adding note on this , cos task news followup there is nothing like only completed!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple task management"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I don't get it. Billion dollar companies who publish half-heartedly designed software. If you were serious about tasker you would at least make it more intuitive with a better prioritization system (e.g. 5 levels)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good application my Google saves having to remember it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Is it possible to add a search function?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Reminder does not work at all"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Quite helpful for listing down tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"sorting issue when there are sub-tasks available"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"App needs a reminder that notifies one ahead of time of a planned task not just popping up."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Really loved It... Thanks to the developer"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Needs a bit more. Great quick to do app, however usually when one makes a list they start with most important. With the limited sorting options the first items go to the bottom and I need to rearrange them all. I think an animation of the list items floating up to the top would be a cool way to achieve this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I need easy instructions to search within this app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Needs full screen desktop app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very handy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple to use, makes things easier to remember and also increases productivity by separating set of tasks into lists. Very useful for individuals"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Reminders don't work and I don't understand, why. Okay, I found out battery setting and fixed it. But still need snooze button for reminders, for example for one hour."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Should sync better with other services"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"for fills its purpose and is really easy to use and has many helpful tools to help keep organised"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love this app as it integrates with the calendar. But hopefully we can collaborate on tasks. Or get keep integrated with calendar. Either works."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very good app. Would love to see search and device integration (such as caller etc.)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, super useful but I wish they will add different ways to sort tasks like by deadline for exmple"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"proper! like it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Captain G Prabaharan"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I need to be able to reorder my lists in the app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Now broken since the android vapp update. Can't even sign in anymore.. server error FFS."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The only thing that's missing is a dedicated web app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Why I can't trying set up goals? Is taht feature deleted?:("
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good but should include ringer notification"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use. So easy my cat could do it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"No dedicated web fronted available & Unfortunately recurring tasks marked completed do not show up in the task list. Expected behaviour: Once the most current iteration is marked done, the next one should show up in the list. - And very bad, Google is ignoring this topic since 2019 :-("
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"0pna"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Less is more"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Add An Additional Feature Called ""Search"" Give Us An Option To Search. Thank 😊 You."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"alarm poor"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's simple, syncs perfectly and works great. an unsung gem."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works well, simple to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps keep me on track"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Unsatisfactory I don't have time now."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Does not handle recurring tasks well. New instances of repeating tasks do not appear in your task list until the day they are due - no ability to look ahead and future plan. Very disappointing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I'm using this to help me organise my life. It's fantastic. I have the widget on my home screen. This way, my to-do list is always watching me, staring me down like an unapproving parent. Just like when I was growing up! Wait, is that because I'm not finished growing up? Is that why my to-do list scowls at me? Yes, yes it is. Oh lawd now I'm talking to myself. All while typing a review on Google. This can't be good. I need to create a task for seeing a psychiatrist. Tasks! That's what I was...."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"टॉप रिमांड"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Perfect easy Task App! Love it!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Add color coding in every task please"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is great. Perfect for organizing my chores and bills. But I have a few suggestions: allow tasks us to move a task from one list to another, sub tasks for a given task, allow a task to reoccur more than once per day, and allow a reminder for the task before it's due. Other than that the app is really well done."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good but not great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"amazing app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Changing a Weekly task to Daily task doesn't move it to Daily list, you can't move it manually either! Also would be great of there was options to 1. Collapse subtasks 2. Reorder the lists, for eg to have urgent first. Even though there is a sort option called ""My Order"" I can't seem to change the order of lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is awesome!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Hot. good for ADHD retards like me :)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Rocks my world. Let's you set the day, time & alarms. You can also synch with your Google calendar which saves you time by not having to write the same bloody thing twice."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"atleast this gave me an notification sound!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"There needs to be an option to collapse all the subtasks when viewing the entire list. Also, where is material you ?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I think it's a very nice app but it'd be better if one could share one's tasks with others It could serve as a project management tool"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simplistic and Really Usefull✨"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good to add a Task to the Google calendar on mobile But being able to create an event or convert the task into an event on Google calendar on mobile would be a Big plus feature - this feature is available on desktop only at the moment"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"we want hours reminders now only available remaining options every 1 day,or every 2 day i want remind every hour option every 1 hour or 2 hour or 3 hours please add latest bete version"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Improvements required: The data is syncing between the devices iphone and Android This is one awesome productivity app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Solid functionality"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"they were good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Far too basic. Needs task importance and tags. And the ability to see all tasks, not just individual lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"you asked me to rate it. don't be so thirsty"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please add the ability to sort alphabetically."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great but wish there was a way to customize snooze time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"so helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"how did I ever get things done without this task list? I wish I could say ""ok Google, add task"" or similar to get a faster note onto my tasks. then will I give 5 stars"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Okay I have to keep up with task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The app I've been waiting for my whole life. Helps with my ADHD."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"so cool!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"yeah it's good. simple, works well"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Though I like the app, there are some improvements required. 1. If I created a project and added subtasks. The date set for project should automatically apply to all sub-tasks. Because when I sort list by date, the subtasks appear independent of the project created and not under the project. Annoying. 2. If reminder facility is integrated to G-tasks it would be a complete package. Have to check the tasks everytime and chances of missing them."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Hadn't got a hold of that over yet but I know that I will as my business expands."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love it, dose exactly what I needed to do!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Widget in Android not stable"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"If you want my opinion. There is no greater app for keeping track of my personal and business affairs."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Essential"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Pressing enter after adding a task doesn't allow me to keep typing and adding tasks, you have to press the add button again which is annoying if you have a big list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Does job"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Where is the option to set Monday as first day of the week, please??? It is super annoying to have Sunday as first week day."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Widget is convenient, app is annoying sometimes but it's alright"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Just combine Google Calendar with this task app. Calendar takes care of the day and this app does with task. Would not it be better to create some task and check it off ."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't have Material You Design"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Recurring tasks disappear after you check it as completed. So fix that and have an option to decide how many days ahead you want to see an upcoming or recurring task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helpful in keeping habits at check!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I just want a million dollars. Doesn't seem like I'm gonna get it though 😕"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Fantastic, easy to operate and makes your life easy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is probably one of my lifesaver apps. As someone forgetful and creative. I tend to drop quick notes and to-dos when the ideas pop into my head. Looking at it only later when I'm in my working mode. This synergizes with Desktop really well, and through 3rd party enablers you can share Task lists too. Very very useful app for sure, especially if you're using an Android."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Had been super helpful to keep me on task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"In order Google for me to give you more stars I would need more help getting my tasks done so if you can help me with my task on daily living and just privacy sometimes then the more help on tasks the more stars on post I shall give you g team for we need that"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I enjoy the app, but wish it had an option to snooze notifications; especially if this is taking the place of Assistant notifications."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Useful app, but annoying that about 5 to 10% of the time, my notifications randomly fail to appear. Can be rather frustrating if I'm relying on the app to remind me of something in a timely manner."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent service"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Edit 12/15/22: homescreen widget exists! I wish you could set a task as important and it would be able to persistently remind you(like a snoozable alarm), I often miss the single notifications to call people etc. Integration into chat and gmail is great! I wish it had some features of Keep and visa versa. Original review: Still missing a widget feature and reminders. GTasks still works well and has both of those features and integrates with the to-do list that is available in Google Calendar..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple to use, and helpful pop up reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I can't use location as a reminder. Really odd decision to remove this option."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"All my family my name only 😘"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"best apps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"amazing app, what I've been looking for for years. didn't know I wanted a widget until I found this app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Bug? When a task is marked ""complete"", it will close all 'other' apps I am actively using. It should ONLY close the tasks and not anything else."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Can be improved. NEED Colour schemes for the list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice and simple. integrates with Google calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"💯👍👍"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"hourly reminder need for task which needs to be done by every few hours"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Like it. I have 2 improvement asks. 1. Sort tasks alphabetically. Sometimes I can't remember if I've already added something, but then have to look at every entry to be sure. 2. Show next reoccurring task after current occurrence is complete. Would be nice to know when it's due next before it is the day to do it, or have it done by."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"great, although having it overlap with Google keep for shared lists is a little confusing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"doesn't ""remind"" even though alert setting us on. so I miss all reminders, unlike ios"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A bit too saavy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"adding details should be easier though. like just adding to title of each task. I think it just should a list each one, not a title and then have list each one in details."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Will periodically auto-complete all your repeated tasks, even ones you haven't finished yet and send them to the next recurrence."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app helps me keep track of tasks I need to complete, both at home and at work. It's deep Google integration makes it easy to use, no matter the device I am using (phone, tablet or PC)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"What a wonderful piece of work we have here. Navigated so easy from the start. Love the fact that it gels nicely with my Google Calender. Fantastic..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This could have been better in terms of UI. Thank You :)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"progress bars"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Wish you could more easily set dates"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Works okay as a replacement for a reminders but definitely miss the best feature; being able to snooze stuff!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very Nice Task App."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It gets the job done. But the little things can be bothersome. Like the fact I have to use the desktop version just to arrange my Lists? No color option? Reoccurring tasks is a pain too."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"perfect for me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Cool works"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"keyboard"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I tend to be harder on Google than other apps cause I feel like they should have their stuff together better than anyone else. That being said it's a solid app that coordinates well with other apps but that UI is bland and lacks stimuli. Just saying."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Google Keep is overall a better option than Tasks!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Google tasks has been helping me navigate my daily routine easily and in a week, i've engaged in habits i used to think was hard.. #iLoveThisApp BUT i'll appreciate it more if the devs can make the radio button not disappear when i checked it after completing a task because i want to see the things i've done and stuffs that remains.. After that, i'm giving this app 5 stars A.S.A.P"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"very simple and great to use, but there should be an easy way to delete alot of task easily at a single time ."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Easy to use app that synchs well with Google calendar to seamlessly track and accomplish your tasks. User friendly interface that is straight forward and un fussy. One way to maximize this app would be more customization for reminders, ranking importance of tasks, and a sort of reward system or notification when tasks are completed (Perhaps a track record of recurring tasks)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Being watched from afar .. How sweet"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"thank youuuu"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"There is no hourly reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A nice and user friendly tool for managing tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The only reason I use this app is its integration with other Google services; This is important for me because I use Google for literally everything. The app is fundamentally solid, with being able to create different lists and set repeated reminders. However, I wish I could give tasks different priorities like TickTick, as well as having different sections on a single list. That being said, it is a great to-do-list app that suffices for everything I do."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The lack of ability to share tasks is disappointing, but it suits well enough."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Anything google is a lie and a fraud. Twitter under musk will reveal many more lies from multiple companies Full speed ahead.. burn these corrupt communist run companies to the ground."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Update: would like to see this as an app 9n my pixel watch. A very useful app. Linking it to calendar and available across docs streamlines my day. I would love the ability to colour code tasks and add it to assistant and android auto are next on my wish list for the app. I find I use it more now than Google keep."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"useful and easy to use and manage tasks and subtasks. I like the category feature."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Would have been even more efficient if allowed shortcuts for the lists on the home screen!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Stopped getting notifications for scheduled tasks unless I open the app. Which has caused me to miss several tasks I had scheduled due to the app not sending me a notification"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Please do something about the app especially on the widget and the theme of the app I think that we all need the match of android 12 colors with it, if not then it will be just a trash."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"AMAZING"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Two suggestions to strategy team (i) Introduce notification tone to tasks whenever they get triggered to bring attention. (ii) A task can be postponed or ammended...it should have an option. Rest the app is a charm."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Too much lingo to understand. I was looking for something to use as a reminder.tool"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"this doesn't have a lot of features that would be expected of a task list or reminder list. the issues are too numerous to list here but I am sure you can look them up yourself"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent App for keeping life straight!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Your logo is horrible... please change it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I like that it's integrated with other products, but it's very tedious, and the automatic ordering is annoying. I feel better off just sticking to Keep."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great 'Simple but powerful' 'ToDo' Tasks manager. The asterisk system is cool. The only thing missing for me is a means of hyperlinking out to say a specific Google Doc which would contain further links and info on the task. It may already have this? But not see any means."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I didn't want my completed tasks are hidden when I'm launching the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Nice app but it doesn't work with the watch yet the watch has been out a while and they don't improve this app. Wow !!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"really poor app, recurring tasks don't always recreate themselves, at this pace it's going to be usable in a few years EDIT update 2 years later - still useless, nothing changed EDIT another 2 years passed, still an equivalent of a post-it note"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I think this is one of the best task apps, one improvement would be the option when you do everything in kid task, parent task is done"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Amazing App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very very useful does everything you want without any ads or premium content"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like this app. I wish they would combine Keep and Tasks together. I also wish there was a stand alone web application. I like to bring it up on my lap top and curate my tasks full page and not off to the side of gmail or gcal. Other wise not bad. I like it ."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great product adding to the Google Workspace"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping things on track"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like the idea of having all reminders in a easily accessible place, but I'm very worried about the removal of tasks integration with the calendar. I'm hoping calender integration will remain once the original switch happens."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Synchronisation with Googld calender works as if putting a single new event for each scheduled time of the repetition scheme. Poor performance on Android."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"TASKS Feedback: Given Google's decision to phase-out g-Calendar in favor of g-Tasks: Add SEARCH Function... Add Undelete (task) Option... Add AUTO-SAVE new Tasks (like g-KEEP Notes does)... Add Allow Simultaneous Use of REPEAT; and SUBTASK Functions..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So handy!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I think some features should be revised. For example: I use recurring tasks a lot, and Google Tasks is the only application that doesn't show me the next occurrence of the task prior to the new occurrence date, making it difficult to schedule my next few days. Another idea: a smart information grabber could be implemented, so that when I write ""do X tomorrow morning"" it's automatically prefilled for tomorrow""."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Worst f*u*c*k*i*n*g,trash app. They f*u*c*k*i*n*g deleted my review, orwellian google. Long tasks are never safe in this app, it fails to autosave and if app is in background, it quickly goes out of memory and the lines you have written vanish. Not reliable at all for long tasks, only good for short notes! Also f*u*c*k Google for censoring everything!"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Love so much of the improvements this app has made in the past few years. And, after so many years has passed, I've got a lot of redundant lists that I'd still like to keep but want out of my daily view. Would be great to have an ARCHIVE feature just like Google Keep. 🙏🏼"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app is awful. As far as I can tell, there's no way to permanently erase repeating tasks once they've been created!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app used to be very useful. Now, I noticed that reminders I set are only working if I happen to have the app open and using it. Before, the reminders would actually remind you whether the app was open or not. If I have to rely on myself happening to open the app and looking at the tasks, then that renders the notifications/reminders function useless."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Handy and useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I like its integrated view in Google Calendar and simplicity and repeat task options. But there are issues. 1) If you create a daily recurring task in the Calendar with an end date, the end date is changed to 12/31/1969 which seems to be an overflow issue. 2) If you create a recurring task in the Tasks, it appears on all the dates which makes sense to organize/plan them. But if you create it in the Calendar, only the 1st entry appears, so if mark it completed, there is no way to see it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it is intuitive and easy to use but I wish it had improved reminder options like vibration on or before time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"A really useful app just a can't search for key words in tasks which is a bit of a game changer when you've got lots of tasks and details"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"App does not appear in the app Finder list without being specifically searched for. Further, as a result, the app cannot be added to the home screen, which severely hinders it's functionally and eliminates it's usefulness. In current iteration, this is a pointless app. Edited with update: after rebooting my phone, Tasks finally appeared in the Finder, this issue appears to be more of a bug with the installation process of the app than the app itself."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's so handy to have a task reminder"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Малофункциональное"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I feel like my days are so easier to get through because I'm able to throw everything I need or want to get done on here, and let the app do the rest. Before this, I would use keep for my reminders and to-do lists. It's nice to be able to separate my class notes from my tasks, makes everything so much better."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"reminder is not powerfull."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I'm sure used to have an ""add multiple tasks"" option to save time, but missing in this version. Awkward switching between lists and generally slow and awkward to use. Having got a task list, you can't print, share or export them. Edit: I have given up using this app/Google tasks because you can export/print them. Using Microsoft tasks instead"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"nice app, easy to use, nice U.I"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I need a calender planned out weeks in advance, but yet able to rearrange each task on each day however I would like then organized, sadly the app tells me when I have tasks sorted by date it will not allow me to reorganize them within that date, so I can't put in order the most important things I need to do first and the least important last within that same date. This is a major flaw and makes this app useless for me, I will have to keep searching for one that accommodates my needs."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Muito bom 😌"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"interface isn't very practical and the android widget needs to a click to open the app instead of going to the task itself"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Using this all has really changed my life. I just wish the tasks had the option to ""Show as event"" in Calendar and something like a colour code (like keep notes) also, With recurring tasks, I wish once I click complete, it would jump to show the next date I have that task recurring, rather than showing nothing until the day of. I essentially use my tasks as a Calendar diary on my home screen, and I've met a lot of people that do the same and I think these functions could go a long way"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Nice,, please improve to print completed task and sort by name can be view.. thanks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's simple and minimalistic. There are no ads as well"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Give An Option To Postpone Any Task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Liked goals in Google calendar, I used it for the chores in my household. I could color code, per person and change dates or move things. This app is more like just using a reminder. Won't be able to use this like I need."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"App integration into Calendar is faulty. Can't have repeating Tasks beyond the month. They are set to repeat indefinitely and there's no ""till date"" parameter. And when trying to fix it things just go haywire. Deleting and creating similar ones one adds to the problem. Specially aince it does not allow to add tasks in the past. It is really helpful to keep track of things. Please add this functionality Devs, after repairing the core functionality."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"An easy to use it is. Got me going with few clicks."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I really wish google would make it easier to integrate all google services in a user friendly interface. i want my calendar to provide task checklists on the day they are scheduled. i want to be able to create checklists for individual kids and when I share it to family calendar i want it to not post to the calendar in an incompatible format. i want to be able to view my calendar on my google hub. each of googles apps are so basic and simple on their own, they should be able to be a single app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I'm loving it 😍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"NEEDS A SEARCH FEATURE. Too few lines displayed. Needs check boxes."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I love the app, but I would love a way to show all the tasks in one place, instead of having them be on their designated list.

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I use Tasks as a personal planner. Easy to use, you can sort tasks by importance, set categories, set reminders etc. Everything one needs to keep up with day-to-day agendas. My biggest 'like' - you can add emails as tasks straight from the Gmail inbox. I recommend uninstalling any third party apps (especially if you are paying for services) and using google tools (available for free with a Google account)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's a good tool to keep track of your tasks both personal and work."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it's okay, there are better, plus Google should choose between using only reminders or tasks with calendar but not both"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Extremely featureless... no alarms, no priority setting, no attachment to tasks, no sharing with other contacts, no postpone option. Disappointing"

They NEVER fire like they're supposed to. It's like Google, one of the largest tech companies in the world, didn't even halfass this... They QUARTERASSED it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Tasks is another great apps you can set it up easy and it even suggests some tasks if enabled"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Hello, commenting and five stars on Google Play is done"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"wish there was color categorizing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I've been using Gtasks for years. I would use the send to put a copy in my email as a backup in case something happened in Gtasks. I lost all my reminders a few years ago! Now the send feature isn't working. Nothing happens when I hit send. I miss this feature. Please get it working again."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I started using this app/service after seeing a YouTube video on the advantage of using it along Gmail and Google calendar. I just wish it had a single page that shows all event due ""today"" instead of having to switch between list to see each lists due dates."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love how it integrates with my calendar and gmail"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Its good, but can't remind you to do things at certain times"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Speeded up my work."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Romantic"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please add share capability!!! This is pretty unusable for me with out that, we will continue to use the haphazard list features in Google keep until share becomes available here."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Merge note taking too"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"subtasks should be collapsible"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"App is really cool, it's a quick task so better to have limited features in it but it seems these 2 are essential 1. Change Task Group post creation 2. Search Task in List"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and very minimalistic"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very useful to keep tasks on hand from going out of sight and mind. Integration with Google Calendar is a bonus, and really useful. An option to add notes to tasks and sub-tasks would be helpful. While deleting completed tasks keeps the app clutter free, sometimes I felt the need for looking somewhere to see what all has been completed over a period of time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Edit : Please Include ""All Tasks options"" and option to ""Sort"" it by TIME/DATE. Thank you, we needed this app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"dope"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple but works great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love this app. easy to understand and use. very shareable."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"My life is way more organized with this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"1. If we don't use date for task.. then subtask of main task are shown properly ... If we use date for a task.. then it's subtask looks like a main task Kindly fix this asap"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's good .."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I haven't had it long. So far it seems ok to keep a task where its access is easy, however I haven't found it to be useful as a reminder."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It's has limited features and doesn't interpret instructions well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great so far"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Useful and easy to use. Was able to figure it out the second I opened the app, and I've been using it everyday. It's helping me get my life together. Love it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great tool to complement google events in google calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"missing search function and not able to add tasks yet with Google assistant but clean and simple and integrates well with Google calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good but if it's link with Google note then it will be better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"No widget! I just want a widget that allows me to see my to do list on my screen without opening an app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Really gets things done."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's overall great but the way it's displayed on my screen is infuriating. It's listing it from the latest task at the top. I'm being hyperbolic but it's about medication so it would be great to have more control over the displays of the widgets."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"need features like priorities."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Although every thing is okay there is a problem that we start but we can't mention end time, its major problem for students"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"This is a good app but it lakes some features. I can't move task between lists or set up a priorities for tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Helps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"😈 devilop3rwws as wimple genesis."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"i just love it❤️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Mokgokong bimakatso mokete 123"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very good app, but I do not think it syncs properly"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very easy and useful App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"bare bone"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Spot on,helpful in so many ways to find task asap"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best App to organise oneself"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Pathetic - Recurring tasks does not work! Use Microsoft To Do; it works everything that this app messes up."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app!!but expects some other features like, getting notification but doesn't have alerts ,want some new features like notification sound..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google continues to provide the easiest and most effective productivity tools"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's ok but missing functionality like Microsoft's to do list. For start when you sort by date all the subtask structure is removed and all task are then same, which makes i difficult to navihate through tasks if you have a lot of them. That is not the case if you use tasks on computer. Fix that first. The subtask can't have repeat option, which is a shame."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Kindly include a feature to sort the lists by our own choice as it is available for tasks i.e. we can sort tasks up and down as we wish"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No dark mode widget"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this App helps to keep being Organised and Boosting Productivity"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very helpful for reminding me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"widget updating gets stuck many times, otherwise best app with less clutter."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I'm not with verizon so i can't use it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Apknya bagus, Sederhana, cuma kurang notif pengingatnya aja"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It works just as expected. Really simple but powerful tool"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"goode!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Widget's dark modd it bad"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very Helpful to keep track of tasks! Love it!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Wish I could choose to re-arrange the starred items list. And also that it was possible to change which list a task is under AFTER setting it as recurring. Doesn't seem to be possible. Also wish it would allow to re-arrange the order of the list headings with a long press and drag. Additionally! Would also also be nice if it were possible to re-arrange the order of tasks within the day they're set for while the sorting option is set to 'date.' Works mostly well with some annoying issues."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This keeps you organized and on task!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"❤️☯️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Works for me. It would be great if you could search for past tasks like you can for past appointments."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"PLEASE ALLOWS US TO REORDER THE TASK LISTS USING THE APP. TQ."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I don't know what happened to this app. It used to work fine, but recently it's had big problems. I have a reminder scheduled for every 25th day, but it seemed to be notifying me too often. At some point I checked and it notified me only 11 days after the previous. Separately, I had a weekly task that it was supposed to notify me of last night at 10 pm but I didn't get it until 12 hours later. It had been reliable until now. What good is this app with these problems?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple and easy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I thought it would connect to my Google calendar and it doesn't and the notifications aren't repetitive enough"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy to use and I can make multiple task lists and I can add it to my calendar if I need to"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"broke my ankle and i am using it to keep my medications schedule on track absolutely perfect. notifies me and was able to put it on repeat for the days. only thing that would have been nice is the option for repeating in hours, so I wouldnt have had to put so many tasks in. otherwise love it its great. plan to keep using it even after Im healed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Using it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Too simple, should have options to at least export tasks as .csv / .pdf / .xls etc."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"should me more customisable"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Can't use your voice! Google Assistant ""hey Google"" does NOT work with this app. I hope you like typing and clicking unnecessarily."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Needs assistant integration to be really useful, I should be able to set a reminder for myself by asking for a reminder that I don't have to manually sync over."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app. I love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This is nice but you should probably be able to long press and drag tasks between lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"trash"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great App for Task Management"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Can't figure out how it works!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The biggest problem with this app is it doesn't plays alarm it sucks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Nice to have a good app . Only thing is that sub task feature needs to be add"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"While it is a very simplistic todo list, integration with google calendar makes it really powerful. Good experience if not great."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very useful and very good app for to do list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Widget text is so big that's unusable. This widget leaves no space for anything else. It should use the same text size and style as GCalendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Needs Widget."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"good overall. UI could use improvements though"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"improve notification sound and timing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"i like the layout and easy to use interface but they need to add a few more features like having a shortcut to your task list on the front screen/lock screen....etc (i don't feel like typing an essay here )"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Exactly does what it is intended for with optimal and seamless usage."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good integration with google calendar but some basic stuff (like subtasks) doesn't work as usual and it's frustrating."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simply the best app for personal task management. I am much more productive after I found this app. It's biggest advantage is that it's perfectly integrated with google calendar with drag and drop sync. That's perfect for me since I use Google Calendar every day. I highly recommend this app for those who are looking for an app to manage tasks from multiple aspects of their life and be more productive."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Too basic. No export. Etc."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Can't wait until this fully replaces Google Reminders!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent, does the job without added gimmick and super light with clean interface."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"+ Perfekt to do list app in Google ecosystem - no sharing option's with others. MS solutions of To Do app allow share with others, for example groceries. So I am forced use two apps instead of one."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Why would I need this as a separate app we already have Google keep"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Quality. Just customizable to be useful, but not so much that it becomes a time-waster. I wish some of the subtasks and repeating items could do a little more, but overall I'm satisfied."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"A feature I would love to see is the ability to drag and drop tasks from one list to another. Also the ability to collapse/expand subtasks view so they're not taking up screen space."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"There should be drop-down list for subtasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Google should add more features to this app to make it more engaging."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Stop disabling my tasks. Stop turning off my apps. You know who you are. So do I. Let the good apps function. They update themselves through app and phone personalization options. You don't need to turn them off when an update would have sufficed. And stop subverting my accounts, you look ridiculous on my console. Gtfo and let google, android, and samsung do their jobs. Then I can do mine correctly. 5 stars."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"best app for reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's cool I just want it to be able to attach photos though"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Widget dark mode is buggy. Only half the widget is dark, why is the other half still in light mode?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good app for essentials. Google, if you're listening, please add a drag and drop for the tasks to set the order, which helps with showing the most important ones first."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Great App✌️ Edit: The widget of the app is very badly coloured or is it just my phone? The top of the widget is white while the bottom part is dark , the font-colour is dark gray on dark background making it difficult to understand. Please let me know if there's a solution to it'."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"it doesn't populate in my Gmail on my computer"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Would love to have sharing capabilities for the tasks. I was looking for a task list for some groups I'm in and I like this one, it's easy and simple, but I can't share. Not real time time anyway. I think having an option to keep completed tasks on the list instead of disappearing would be nice too. I know completed tasks are still viewable, but the order changes."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helpful feature. Easy to use. Like the way it integrates with the rest of Google, especially being able to attach an email with details about the task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great easy to use app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I use it everyday."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good App!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best Task Manager App."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I love the simplicity of Tasks. I would give it 5 stars if there was an option to see all tasks in a consolidated list so that you could get a ""big picture"" view of all your tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"ADHD IS REALITY. THIS APP KEEPS PROCRASTINATION AT BEY.😜"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I would really appreciate if it gave me an option to have a set of tasks and have them reset every day or week or 9 days or anything, just let it be customizable to the user because it would be helpful and it's also the reason why I installed it. I got this app so I could keep track of things I would like to achieve every day and making it more manageable would be greatly appreciated, thank you for this survey."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Been patiently waiting for the feature to add emails to tasks from the google mail app. thanks!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Simple, fácil y siempre actualizada en todos mis dispositivos. podría tener opciones extra como notas de voz o imágenes, pero en general muy util."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works to do what it needs to"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Would be five star but I can't export tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app. keeps me organized"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"no checking sound!!!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Keeps you on track"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"No nonsense!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Not sure why but dark mode version has a dark grey font color so it's hardly visible."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's very useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Period."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"mad app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"He said he trust google chat so! means i won't! he deserves to go to jail!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simply superb"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"JJ. hello"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Are my tasks available to Google to see, analyze and personalize? Why is there no mention of privacy in the app info?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Why on earth does this app don't have search option ?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Handy to have tasks directly accessible"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Such a mediocre app. Can't move tasks to another list. Recurring tasks are terrible and when I use the widget to add a task, it opens the whole app which makes the widget pointless. There's no 'today' view so I can see which tasks are due today. I have to go to Google Calendar to see that. No reason to leave Todoist for this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it! ❤️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Lack of customization options. I have certain tasks and notes associated with different colors in other apps, so at a glance I can know what needs doing when, without reading what the note is about. Looking to consolidate and streamline my organization; between the limited/clunky options provided by Google Calendar and this... app, it's just not as functional or efficient as it could be."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love using this app more than on a desktop version of Google calendar at times. It has extra features and if I need to change the date or time, it's quicker to change on the app. I like that it remains on your top bar as a reminder. Definitely recommend"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Who knows"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Update: I've sadly had to change it to 3 stars, as twice now it's lost important information I've entered by the time I reopen the app. Google, please fix this frustrating bug! Awesome for making notes of what you need to do. I am pleased you can make different lists. Only reason I've given four stars instead of five is that there's no option to add new tasks to bottom of list - they automatically add to top, so I have to reorder them every time. Small price to pay for otherwise perfect app imo!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Used to be the better tasks/canvas website. That worked reasonably well. That website is no longer alive, so am using this app now. Within the first five seconds of using the app I can tell a lot of features are missing, most notably: search... something Google is supposed to be pretty good at!! what a joke. Can't print/select and copy all tasks in a list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I can live still on a calendar with out this app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not very intuitive. Customisation menu is limited. Change it right away after using it for about 3 days only."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Optional"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Definitely helps keep me organized. This is the 4th task taking app (to do list type app) I've tried. So far, this one is the most functional and useful. Adding color for the more visual learners of the group would be nice, and maybe a pleasant come for completed tasks. Not necessary for the functionality, just pleasing. Overall, pretty great."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Easy to use and is helping me develop a good routine"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I think Google Keep Notes app is better than this app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great help with my poor memory."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"would be great to have integrated reminders in Google Chrome on my Mac and or via Outlook or Gmail"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"pretty good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"should be part of calendar on Android, like desktop"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I found this App to be difficult to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"the app supports well now, but something needs more improvement like sorting tasks based on their due date; Need more places to access task such as web,..and app should notify always for tasks overdue,..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The best!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Needs to have repeating date option when adding subtasks why do subtasks cause that option to go away and vice versa? Seems like an oversight please fix"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app to help you stay productive. Helps me everyday at work, I'd love to see it on the galaxy watch 5 store. Also would love to be able to share my list with other people!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Would like subtasks or linked tasks. But basics are solid."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Have lost data twice. Not reliable."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Great tool.. would be goof if the reminders and tasks synced automatically tho"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very useful. I'd be nice if there was more google assistant connectivity."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I wish I could use Google Assistant with it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It has too many confusing interactions with google products..another over 'engineered innovation...its back to the hard"" to do list for me. Seniors beware."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"please add option to add subtask to repeating tasks and also add option to set time period for a particular task instead of exact time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love this for tracking Todo items"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I would add a way to pass from one list to another one by swiping left or right. It would be faster."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Why can't the tasks be searchable? I would understand not putting in this simplest feature if your company's business isn't based on, you know, searching..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very helpful easy access love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Sorry, just way too little features."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"missing some important features"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good features"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It lacks the functionalities of a habit tracker, such as measure the streaks is recurent tasks and could be more integrated with Google Keep, like being able to set Keep's reminders as tasks and so on."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good use and fantastic app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"If I could tell the assistant to add a task to my (insert task list name here) list , or if I could have recurring tasks instead of changing the date every time I am done with the current recurring task that would be lovely."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"wish it had task reminders when they are overdue."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome!😍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Mediocre app. An app that is suppose to be helpful is disappointing. It's task sorting abilities are subpar. If you sort by date it'll show all subtasks below all other tasks, ungrouped, marked undated. It only shows the option to repeat a task if you have the reminders both date and time set."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Not good for monthly tasks. Once completed the task stays there the whole month, greyed out forever, unable to be checked if completed earlier."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Need more organizing tools and a SEARCH"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Loved it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not showing any remainder except pop up in status bar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Task means reminder also must be, there is no reminder alarm"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it works pretty well and has a decent widget"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I have to use this app more often but it's gud to have and great when a task is complete then accomplished. For, me it seems like I'm in the beginning stage. That is why I like this app because Im not done until every division is deemed successful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"brilliant little tool"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's cool"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"One less star for - Unable to edit heading & change sequence"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Should be 5 stars but for a few features l would like such as the search button colour coding lists. This app is the one you are looking for if you are a person who is always thinking after a task that what to do next and if you forget important tasks after a few minutes. The best feature is it lets you sync across devices using your account. I am a Grade 10 student and it suits me perfectly (It is quite rewarding/satisfying to see your pending task get done and deleted)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"gud"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Confused by too much info"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"contribute to everyday life productivity"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Please give option to rearrange list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I just wish Google Task app would be something similar to Microsoft Todo app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Thank you"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome app to list your tasks. Simple!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great basic listing app. Easy to add items and prioritize. Cant share lists with others, though."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"everything is awesome... but please add a search bar on top it would be helpful.. I use it for a lot of things so it's hard to scroll all the way down and search that if I already added that movie/series/book or something!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Make a list on phone, can find it again when logged in on the desktop. Win."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy to use without a bunch of extra nonsense or ads"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Pretty awesome, except the feature to delete your list and completed tasks are still next to each other making it too easy to accidentally delete your list. If this remains this way, I'm willing to STOP using this app and just go to Google keep."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I used this app to remind me of my meds daily (since I easily forget) and 1/3 of the times, I wouldn't get notifications of those reminders and then forget to take my meds... This is the point of this app, to get notifications to remind you of tasks and it doesn't even work. Uninstalled and will use another app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Does not sync with the people with whom I have shared the specific lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Bro...nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"অসাধারণ"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"sometimes an edit in a existing task disappear when I close the app fast, so, make it offline and update it only when I am connected to the internet"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good, but editing of repeating tasks seems to be impossible."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Too simple. need more features like color coded tasks, attachments, locations, Reminder for tasks. I think make the features like when you add new events on google calendar is enough to make this app way much better.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Doesn't allow returns for paragraphs between two details. Examples: 1) 2) Will just show DONE on keyboard, and place them on exact next line."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Not now Later"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Request to give option to move list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Dr Er Aishwarya Pratibha Mandlik"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Collapse option for task is not there in mobile app like subtasks are visible even if I don't want to see until I expand the main task but it's there in taskboard web. It makes messy rather than organized without collapse expand option for mobile app. Should be added."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"❤️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It helps when you need it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this app! I use it to keep track of my author Street Team assignments and have also used it to keep track of writing assignments in the past. The ability to create tasks from Gmail is perfect for what I use the Google Tasks app for."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"need ability to share"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Amazing design and interface"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Quite useful for keeping track of tasks that need to be done. Would be 5 stars if the app kept track of which days a repeating task was marked as completed to be viewed later."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I waited fir it, with google apps I can access easily to my stuff from any device. As usual Google ease your life👌🏻🤝🏻"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"This app and other google's app dont have night them."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Don't ask me for a review in app. While I'm trying to use the app. Annoying."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Growing and using more but would like more features added to make it more useful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app. I wish reminders were a bit louder and also I wish they were programmed to raise more awareness, to assert urgency though. Otherwise, again, it's a great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Absolutely fantastic app, I use it pretty much every single day to keep track of my tasks and link it to the rest of my Google account apps. Really productive, easy to use and very easy to sync on your Android devices, I would say it's a must have for productivity."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"TCL Ecumenical"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Tasks don't appear at scheduled time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app! I have a few feature requests though--the ability to archive lists and the ability to move the order of the lists (not just the list items inside the lists). It's getting cluttered, but I really don't want to delete old lists."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Perfect for helping me not forget things"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nothing else to say but awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Would be nice to have a sync with Google Keep as well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Not a bad way to keep track of your task. Can use more refining but overall not bad."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"quirky but simple"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Don't got anything to complain about, would recommend."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good app. I have found myself pulling over while driving to add something into it because I know I won't remember it when I get home."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"the app is very good but when phone is locked it can't notify you"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"This app is lacking. The fact that I can't move a repeating task to a different list is just inexcusable. I mean, why? I really hope Google puts more time and effort into Tasks. I'm a fan of using the native apps with an OS. I'd also like to be able to drag and drop tasks in Calendar. Doesn't work for all day tasks for some reason. I'm holding out hope! Don't let us down, Google."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Thank-you so much google for this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Does its work very well. I just wish you could add emails from some contacts to tasks (as tasks) automatically."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very interesting app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good but could be better. Would like to be able to see data on when exactly a task was last ticked off my list. Also, when moving a task that happens every X number of days to e.g. the next day, the 'X number of days' isn't updated accordingly."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Good for becoming more productive 🙂"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I expected notifications at the time i entered along with note. I'm getting notifications only if i open app Or way later than i time i entered."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Describe"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I prefer an app for reminders only."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love the interface and programming"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled . No sharing available on mobile app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I'm very glad to have an app that is not a bloated mess of details. The calendar integration makes it great and the team at reclaim.ai have made it such an amazing tool. I can capture my tasks in other lists and then deploy them to the automatic scheduled where they are organized."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it's ok. but please integrate tasks to Google keep. and remove reminders in keep. and add task alert based on location (like reminders was). and remove reminders from Google Assistant aswell, and replace with tasks.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Unable to add an end time this app seems to lack quite a bit of nuance. That would be needed to make it necessary when you can already have some of these features in the calendar, which is kind of stupid that you can't switch between making a task an event and vice versa. Like usual Google drops the ball"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Oasis senses massage and spa"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simply Elegant"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"On this app easy to create and manage tasks very fastly."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's alright. Could be more fun though."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Bring back the cute doodled people!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Constantly disables itself, requiring multiple clicks on mobile to use. Auto-updates are on. Doesn't have this annoying behavior on web."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Extremely basic, which to be honest, is kind of the point. I think it's great and use it as an assignment manager as part of Google Workspace for Education, however, sometimes I want to do stuff it just can't do. Why can I only attach an email to the task if I add it from Gmail? Also, where's Material You support? It feels half baked for a Google app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's ok.could use improvement but it's useful though...."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A nice and simple way to keep track of things I want to get done. It encompassing reminders makes the most sense now, I think..."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this is the App I needed all along."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Just what I wanted. Love the widget, love that it syncs to my calendar but is easy to hide, love overall that it's basically an easier version of calendar so I can use it for more ""task list"" rather than ""planning"", and the input is faster."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this application is really useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this app. use it for daily life"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best method for me to organize all the things. several areas of my life has it's own list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"more structured than keep, still completely customizable."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I've been trying to learn how everything works.I am terrible with passwords and the only problem I have ran into is text now want send me my codes. I tried desperately to recover it because I am a blogger ."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I find this little app remarkable!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not good. Task lists do not automat. order alphanumerically and are extremely messy. You cannot change a task into a calender item. Lacking many useful features. Why do you use ""today"" ""tomorrow"" and not exact dates? I am old and dont realize at once what date is today and tomorrow. Why dont you use the year in the current year? It must be clear 28th Oct 2022 and not just 28th Oct. The old TASKS app by Smart Switch ver 1.5.3 was simple and excellent but it is no more regarded as ""safe"". Pity!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Way too easy to accidentally delete a task. How do I recover it?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This simple app is great as it links and synchronises to your task list within the calendars. It took me a while to find it and resolves my frustration also with not being able to see tasks as a list or completed tasks in other apps."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helpful app!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app. Helps me to keep my life on track"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"ft is FB mo"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simplicity with enough robustness to help me get more of my ""Tasks"" done! it will help you too try it now!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great app. we need a desktop standalone version too"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"it doesn't work"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very useful app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The widget is horrible"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I'm surprised this app is NOT available for the Pixel Watch. The apps simplicity and function is perfect for the watch. Please consider this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app for forgetful people..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"this apps does a great job at being simplistic while being highly practical!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app. only features that are really missing are: - ability to share lists with others (even if just read only) - ability to re-sort / reprioritize the lists themselves"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice and simple"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Recurring tasks respawn too late in Gmail."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is good because I remember my to-do's it doesn't log"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So far, a great app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Loved it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Please provide the user the ability to see at exactly what date and time the tasks was created in Google tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"tamaam"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good and simple"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Easy to use but has zero sharing functionality. It really blows that I can't share my todo list with my wife."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Not so good because isn't showing my google calendar when I set a task. When you set a task it displays a blank calendar wich is not useful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I like it but honestly, how is it possible that we don't have an option to rearrange the Tasks Lists?!? And it's an app used to help you organize 🙄 Other than that, it doesn't easily offer the option to have a shared list, which is bad coming from Google, with all the shared stuff they offer."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best application for collaborative task sharing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Lack of customization"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So good ☺️😜"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Quick, flexible and easy,"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Janky Assistant integration. Assistant doesn't know about any reminders kept/migrated to taks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I used this app for my usually life and I liked. thanks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Now I wish I could repeat tasks with subtasks. Update: can now see tasks in calendar mode. I wish I could see tasks in calendar in mobile"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Too simple, some additions should be made to arrange things, priorities, colors etc."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very lightweight, quick and intuitive. It's exactly what I need."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"very good app. would be even better if the next repeat task was listed rather than appearing on the day of completion."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"call"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Keeps important things up front, no need to go looking for emails to track things!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Cool apps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Amazing app must try this one I use it every day !!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Its decent. Definitely not feature rich or anything but it works best with Google Calendar. I would like it more if you could sync between Google accounts but that's my specific use case. Overall, it's alright."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"In my opinion anything Google is always going to be top-notch"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Will give it more rating if they add an option for sound alarm."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excelente"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I won lotto i won triplle double diamonds an alot more peolpe been stiling from me sence 2018"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Awesome for Todo lists. I'd also like a 3 step process, e.g. ""Todo, doing, done"" to better control my workload"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good aps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's amazing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app for setting reminders just wish there was a wear OS version to sync"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great tool for keeping track of tasks. very easy to use and a good overview of tasks. Good integration with google calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"App Version: Specifically the widget. I recommend adding the *option* to have the widget as ""view only"" so that you can view tasks but not accidentally check them off as you swipe through the screens of your phone. Desktop Version: Allow the Gmail Tasks bar to expand to fill more than 20% of the screen. A lot more. Like half. Or the whole thing. Either that or bring back the full screen tasks."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I just wish there was an option to have persistent notifications for this app. This way, I don't forget my reminder. maybe Google can add persistent reminders to Android"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app, though I'd enjoy little congratulations messages or animations as seen with Microsoft's ""to do"" list. I need to feel like I finished some big quest."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like it how it is but could use some improvement but it does what is demanded from it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice simple app to stay focused. Widget and Calender integration are nice features."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Effective aap"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is a great app!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"App is good but instead of keeping Google keep for notes,reminders and task for tasks ,it'll be great if task and Google keep gets integrated. All the features and functions in one app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's good at reminding you what you need to do and when you need to do it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"noice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it's great, but could use more features and integrations with various things such as Google Assistant and Outlook or Google calendar. also all these task apps have one problem which is it's easy to accidentally delete a task by swiping in my opinion, this doesn't really bring as much convenience as it does nuisance. also, I wish I could collapse subtasks as they make my task view polluted."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is a great task management app. It will be better if Google include priority option so that anyone can organise their tasks based on their priorities."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great ."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not as good as Gtasks. Can't sort by name. You have to manually sort for this option."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Must app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"works effectively"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"My experience is especially sl"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Google started out strong, making flexible and versatile apps. Seems as though they'v decided to coast on their early success. This app's developement lacks keyboard support, navigation options, too few menu choices, and the settings only consist of two items. ""What's New"" as of October 3rd, 2022 includes ""General improvements and bug fixes"" - really? Like what? The fact that Google let's this app claim to be part of their collection say's that functionality developement is unimportant."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"There are no real criticisms, no matter what people say. Works very well!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It need s 🔍search button"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"make application work in team so that manager assign work to team members ....on adding task notification should show on team members"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very nice!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"GREAT! 5 STAR"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"there could be some improvement in feature, including easier assigning days in calendar for continuous event, adding task status such as ongoing or pending. the alarm are occasionally worked, maybe some bugs"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love the simplicity and integration into Google products so I can see it in my PC browser or mobile device instantly. UPDATE: Thanks for adding dark theme to the widget, but the gray text it's hard to see on the black background."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"wish it was more like outlook task manager"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"You can only add a date if the task is recurring. Useless"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works well thanks!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"the best simple and sharable app for tasks 100% recommend"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and helps me doing everydays tasks."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love it!!!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great productivity apps !"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Wonderful And Lovely"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Microsoft To-Do is much better. Google is a ""software company"", but it's product doesn't mean so. If something is added to tasks with time, it should automatically add it to remainder. This basic functionality is not available."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"96Ｓ２Ｋ８"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great to use, gave 4 stars only because I think it would be great to have a alarm like feature instead of notification while setting up date/time for a task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very simple yet well designed app. Perfect for any kind of list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great, simple"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It needs a way to automatically reminds to you complete the task!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"On Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro with Android 11 Europe ROM, the widget freezes often (widget will not update), having to restart the phone"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Completely useless. Simply does not give you notifications it's only function. If you set a notification for every day it will give you all your tasks at once, not at the specified time even, once a week if you're lucky."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The app has improved quite a bit since launch. I wish they had a desktop version to use offline"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"wish they had a location task though, but increased my productivity by alot"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The UI/UX is very poorly designed. Tasks as an app works more like someone put it together over a weekend rather than an app that was designed by an enterprise Development team."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love the seamless interface with G calendar. Great for keeping on top of tasks for work and home life."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very nice app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"notification on my pocophone is not working"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Fantastic application!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Simple and convenient for basic tasks, and already integrated to Google Calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"good and links well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Not useful for repeating tasks, but love the rest. Most useful for creating tasks from an email in Gmail and it appears here. I use this ALL the time. Also useful for creating separate lists and a starred list so you can focus. Not sure that you can see a list of ALL tasks, which would be useful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Is part of my daily routine."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Only thing missing is the ability to share and complete lists with other people. My wife and I would like to split a chores list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The fact that to always set a new task always pops up whenever you open the app is totally useless. Then what I had in mind when I downloaded this app was that I would be able to have my to-do list always appear on my home screen saver so that when I look at my phone I'll know what's next on my list. But other than that I like the fact that it automatically connects to your Google account."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"High Productivity"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"useless.. need more improvements"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"not overly complicated. use it for groceries and weekly tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love how I can just add stuff to tasks through my Google. and it's simplified date and time and you can add a little additional information. I just love anything Google so I can't say anything bad because I just love all their stuff except for Google wallet that kind of sucks lol"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Yes I am"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best one"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"just good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's really helpful for completing my each task 😊😊"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Make it possible to re-order lists."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT that the app doesn't have shared lists. It's a better list implementation than Keep Notes but not being able to share a list with someone limits its usefulness."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"A little sluggish on my phone but its alright"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Anandabai"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So far so good we'll see how it goes."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"would be important to also get and manage tasks for exchange email accounts that are synchronized in Gmail"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Osam to good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Add feature we can assign task to our teammate or partners via mail id and must have confirmation button so random people can not interfere. Sticky notification with ringtone so we remember our tasks. Show big notification while device is in locked state."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome 😘"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"no frills but get the basic job of task management done."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple, yet powerful even on free version."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Like everything google, only around until it's cancelled without notice. Officially dead."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I think this is a good app. Although I would love for the app to have access to the camera and gallery. Why?? So as to be able to scan a timetable already drawn for the week and then the app will recreate it and schedule it's reminders according to the timetable. Also the option to repeat the timetable over and over should be available"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use for all ages"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It should be made much flexible, diverse.A person should be able to make a shedule according to his wish and app should remind him according the plan he has made.

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"please to add one more feature like read a book twice a day."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very Good App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I was prompted to rate the app and am reluctant to remove one. However, I must remove a star. The color themeing is not what it should be at this point. I'm using Android 13 and I'm happy to have a dark mode, but where is my beautiful UI? There is plenty more functionality they could be added to tasks to make it my everyday go to task list. Right now, it's one of the"" ones I'm trying"""
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Why does this app need to exist? It worked well in Calendar! My pm tasks keep switching to am."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"As an improvement the widget should follow the system theme, like we have for gmail and keep."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No privacy. Ridiculous."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Only has the most basic of functionalities."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Works fine if you only need a simple to-do list. However, it's well past time to have Material You theming. It just looks out of place among most of the other Google apps."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The + icon for when you long press is still not fixed on Xiaomi devices. It lacks margins and it's blurry, as it is bigger than it should. It's been years since it's like that. Now you mention it as an update and that is still not fixed."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"usefull"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Like it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best app for tracking your Tasks and getting done with them, gotta love it! Thanks Google 😊💙"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"i deleted it not work"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Completely useless if you have recurring tasks. Recurring tasks only appear once. Once you complete it the 1st time, it doesn't reappear on your list until the DAY IT'S DUE. You can't plan ahead. You have to open GCalendar in order to plan ahead for recurrences. If I have to open GCalendar anyways, I might as well just make recurring reminders and not even bother with tasks. Tasks is supposed to be an easy to view ""to-do"" list, but completely fails with recurring tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Don't know but sometimes it gives late task notifications."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Would be nice to make the widget resizable to 2 columns."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like it. It works for me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Worst app doesn't remind the task for given time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Sorely lacking compared to web app. Can't customize beyond light or dark mode, and can't change the order of the lists. Phone app shows tabs in a different order than the web app does, and changing the tab order on web doesn't have any effect on the phone app. Can't easily nest a list item under another without tapping on it and going thru that menu. (Needs to be like Keep) Edit: Now when I check off item on web it stays visible in app list with line thru it instead of going away like web."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to work with 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"You never cease to amaze me, Google Tasks, is so damn cool. IDK but"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Just starting... need something to help an 84 yr old degrading memory... neither Prevagen or Neuriva helped much..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Native for Gmail but meh. I use this and have a zapier auto create the same task in Microsoft ToDo since I can't flag emails to do in Gmail otherwise"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"useful in so many ways I can't begin to list them"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"finally solved my need for a to do list across my devices, love it!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Can have not options and better UI"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Super helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is very useful for priorities I love this app because you can use it for almost anything."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"just what I was looking for, simple and self explanatory. Thanks Google!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works great able to make separate lists for different things and it's easy to keep yourself organized"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Repeating tasks don't work. They just get marked as complete and disappear from your list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It would be really helpful if sub-tasks were collapsible. Otherwise it is a very useful app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"View is Boring"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Lots of potential but still needs a lot of work. A task which repeats should be shown once and float day by day until it's checked off and then another task is created. Either per original schedule or from the day it was checked off. But populating years worth of monthly repeats is useless. And bimonthly tasks are showing up every month. So that's another bug.But the sync between platforms is great so I'm hoping this gets fixed. Wish Datebk would come back (Pimlical just doesn't make it...)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app has been a big help in getting myself organized and staying on top of the household as a single parent."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Not what I expected. I thought there would be some sort of alarm with each task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Love Google Workspace. I like the suite of apps that Google has but my one gripe is the lack of customization options for widgets. The color scheme matches great but the lack of option to change opacity really sucks. Please add an opacity option to all Google Workspace companion widgets!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good app for productivity build up"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Добавьте пожалуйста возможность менять местами списки дел и будет 5)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Application very useful 👌."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Cant see app's widget properly in dark mode, letter comes in grey colour so need correction here.. plz update this. Everytime i use widget instead of app opening. Its simple efficient and fast but in dark theme i can see it properly. I cant upload image here so Hope google will soon come up with this. Thanks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helping me to my planning"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Well it was working for a while until I got blocked from Google chat and then somehow my Google task won't work either so I have a big bug and it just I don't know it just kept going to the front page sign in but it kept doing it there's bugs in the app so please get it fixed but it won't keep me signed into it just letting you know. If not I'll have to not keep it just not install it just the opposite of install. So please get it fixed or I get rid of it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"If this app really can do what it claims then it should come with a walkthrough. I couldn't get it to do much of anything."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"What is the best way to take All this information on Wow"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Could have an automatic connection to emails (making a task out of an email). But in total a very helpful tool."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping track of the tasks you need to get done and is connected to your other Google apps for easy use and reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice. simple interface, intuitive and easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Keeps me on track."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"so easy to use I love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very effective and highly useful! Works across platforms coherently and at a high standard!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice 👍🙂"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Well I haven't quite any tasks so far but I will"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love the simplicity and ease of use. Use it to manage multiple lists at the same time, and sync them around."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"recurring tasks and each completion of occurrence is confusing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"1) It needs to have 1 list for all tasks. 2) It needs to allow us to add attachments to the task itself."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"In terms of planning and convince this is a great tool. Syncing is in a sense immediate. Easy to understand. I recommend it to almost all my friends, family & colleagues."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I value being able to organize my tasks, manage them from my cell phone, and know that they are backed up online. Never miss a deadline!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It would be really great if i can make notes too."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Widget doesn't show subtasks that's kind of problematic."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Everything you need in a Tasks app and then some!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Still familiarising with the app and it's difficult changing old habits. 2 star for the concept. I'll update this review when I have the experience it offers 😉"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Would love alerts that go off on a location not just date/time My work schedule is hectic and after the long days I forget to punch out alot when I get back, but since I leave the main location it'd be great to be reminded to punch I/o everytime I was at the main location"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"wonderful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It really does !"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like taking notes : edit it to Google Tasks !"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"should be able to collaborate"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy and communicates between all my devices"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"An application that helps you increase your productivity, your sense of accomplishment, and your sense of time passing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I really enjoy the feeling that I get from this task list. I would love it if it had a way to generate a list of predefined tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app is absolute trash sometimes. Choosing a task to have a certain number of occurrences sometimes causes the next day to not appear when setting the start date in the past."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Just downloaded. Looks decent and holds all my reminders in one spot for me so that's nice. I can't change a task from one list to another list though. Looks like it should be done via the drop-down on top left but tapping that doesn't do anything. Is it my phone or does this app need an update?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Please add an 'All Tasks' list in the To-Do Widget that combines the tasks of all the lists and displays them in one single list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very useful app once you get the layout and functionality of it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"buena app para organizar mi mes"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"only used couple times, LIKE!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google Talk LLC. thanks you for the best apps ❤️👍😀😃"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"This app would be amazing if you could share or collaborate with people. If that feature was available I'd be able to delete other apps. Seems ridiculous i can share Keep notes, and reminders / events via callander and other apps even Google Home has limited ability to do shared to-do lists and reminders. But the one app Google made to actually be a task manager can't? That seems asinine."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"fast efficient and smooth"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Hi team, sometimes my google tasks app is not showing the notifications of events that I scheduled. Is this a bug?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Decent enough."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,". Ex"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's a very good app for nevigating your daily task. Humans brain is complex by the grace of Almighty Allah. Using this app, always your brain remind to complete your daily tasks. This app is very helpful for students. I hope that Allah will help all to complete daily tasks by this app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Google calendar integration can be better."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Liked this easy too check what I have going on"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Can't simply move a task from one list to another."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Biggest improvement needed: give us a way to reorganize the tabs/folders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Crashing frequently"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love it...yet I have not received it...but my electricity is stupidly ridiculous"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"""Reorder List."""
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very simple and comfortable. I just hoped I can make custom themes and change font."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I needed something just like this...I was in a coma year half with spinal meningitis followed by Colvid. I have several memeory issues with truea amensia... hopefully this will be great store app? I learning .. i broke another phone so basically having to redo this again... Its all great folks im alive getting heathly metal daily.. thank you google.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good to have it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"doesn't remind me about tasks unless I take time to set time. instead should have an auto reminder In witch I choose the frequency. This shish is garbage"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"VERY NON-STRESSFUL AND RELAXING. IT WAS A PLEASANT TIME."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"been intuitive and helpful first couple of days"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"reminds on time👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nic"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it's a more focused version for task and reminders that you need to do daily"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great little tool to help keep track of what needs done by category. Better than paper notes. It would be nice if the app had the ability to send out your lists, like groceries so someone else could help you shop."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"tuyệt vời"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice helper"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good so far, but I wish it had an option to print pdf, of all the tasks to do, as well as completed tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Add 'Go to Date'"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Welll9kk kk kk o"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I am very pleased with the app. You know what would be cool?? An automatic ""uncompleted/pending"" task list. It's kinda tedious to browse each list for pending tasks, especially when I have multiple ones."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Widget is not working after this update. Fix it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it. Use it everyday."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I am easily able to manage my tasks with it and more precisely. I have a suggestion for the team to add a feature to show a panel with dates and tasks assigned to that date. As it can easily helps us to analyse the number of tasks we have assigned to that particular date . So that we avoid overloading of work on same day. In Google Calendar we can easily see number of tasks as banners on dates and so I suggest to add in this app too . Otherwise the app is really productive and easy to use 🙂"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good app! I would ask that we be able to invite collaborators. My wife needs access to the HoneyDo List. Haha"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"This is quite basic with very questionable UX/UI choices. Missing a lot of features still. Idea to move Assistant to this is a really bad one..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app. Can use throughout the Google ecosystem. I wish it was a little bit more visually appealing but an amazing app. Has saved my personal, professional, and educational life"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"the app stops working with the 5G shift"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Outstanding app to note all the things in with facility to see in Google calendar. I liked it very very much and I have been using this app instead hard diary for all purposes with classing as per my choice. Very excellent app. Keep it up and keep safe our privacy also."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice app.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Although it's well integrated with Google services, Lot of features lacking Simple ones like - ability to update repetition cycle - ability to change tag after creating task - next 7 days view"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Useful tool. Ability to share tasks and lists with other users would take it to the next level."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Unnecessary"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"1 star for the widget update changing the colors. It's now hard to read grey on black background. It seems they don't want us to use the widget as it is very difficult to read."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very useful to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's totally brilliant because you can have multiple to do lists and make jobs appear in your calendar. shame you can't share jobs with others!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like the app, is quick and great, would be more greater if some functionalities are added but is fine"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"How does this app not have darkmode and doesn't sync to the google Calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"wouldn't be able to accomplish anything without this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Need option to snooze the task with future time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"feels bulky on my device the widget is good but very laggy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I really appreciate the integration between email and tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"need to add sort options"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I prefer if a percentage progress is added, it give a boost to finish the task and feel me more winner when the task is done"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great productivity and recall tool"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It is good I love it Only thing that brothers me is I have to write all my task again and again everyday. If the app have the 'copy previous task in the new task list' then it'll help even more."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice app for managing daily task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"does what I need"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is very helpful. Awesome."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"We appreciate your efforts thank you"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Repeating tasks does not repeat, once done they don't appear anymore. Used apps fron other companies before and dodn't have this issue."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great help in staying organised."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Best App For Tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"no reminder sucks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome just awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's okay. It functions! Wish the app had a bit more material UI in it. As well as google assistant support would he great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It really helps with daily tasks or Goals you Desire to Complete.i really recommend it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"beet app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Google home devices and assistant need to be able to set reminders and tasks in this app. Have notes/reminders/tasks split between 3 apps is not user friendly"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Continuing to improve, really needs location based reminders though. Hopefully this is in the works. Integration into Google calendar is excellent."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Decent now that you can swipe between tasks. The desktop app sucks though, because it doesn't exist."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"use it all the time! game changer 🙏❤️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love the simplicity of this task list app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it's simple but effective. if you don't weed anything too fancy this app is good. does it have some small issues to the modern user? it can but overall worth using."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"smoothed my daily tasks. Simple and light weight Quick and efficient"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"the best"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Set yourself a task/reminder when you are at a certain place so your phone prompts you with a list of items to buy from a store when you are next there?....nope! This app can't do it. ! It's like location and lists can't be brought together to make your life easier...it's too hard for Google to do that. It's only ,2022 , Google doesn't have that sort of technology yet!!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This app doesn't have a good interface. It's weird and uncomfortable for some reasons. I like that it's connected to my Gmail account. Update: I have found it to be simplistic and the latest update have made it better."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The dumbest version of a Tasks app that Google could make. Made with seeminglno effort or desire to create a nicer user experience, as usual. Still, it loads quickly and the Calendar integration is nice. Not a replacement for a proper task and project management app, like Nirvana GTD"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Add the ability to reorder our lists and this would be much better. Still 5 stars"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"buena app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent app for tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Really great for creating to do lists for home and work. you can add dates for the tasks and sub tasks too. Very useful app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"could better integrate with Google keep, I can't see a reason why these can't both be one app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"no widgets, but it works"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good so far.... Functionality is good, but it needs the ability to personalize it. Themes, skins, etc...."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very easy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"My❤i love it always my"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice interface well structured app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"No good web functionality. Functionality with Google assistance is also lacking."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like that I can add emails to this to do list. very helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Really ez to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This App Is Very Good I Had Too Honestly Uninstall This Though Due Too Lack Of Space On My Device But Overall This App Is Wonderful And Very Well Organized As Well Also Too. So Whom Ever Created This Google Tasks Too Get What Tasks You Need Done Plus Reminds You On Ur Task In Case You forget Is Great So Good Work Too The Intelligent Developer Whom Created This App Very Great App And Would Recommend To Anyone Whom Needs Help Completing With Whatever Task You Need Done Or Remind U Of Tasks 2 Do😊"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Marvelous job..Google."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Truly useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"As I have a tight schedule I always forget what I should do do or will have to do. This app just saved my life professionally, an at personally 👏👏"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Don't like how some functions don't work offline."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"When time is dew notification +alarm or sound not occurring. Need it badly but the concept is good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app. Please can we get ability to open the app via touching side of widget instead of having to find it in the app drawer."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Would love if there is a way to track when the task was completed after it had been checked off"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Export as list would be cool feature"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Most reliable Task manager I use, no matter the phone or OS"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"If we can add interval, rather than just time, it would be nice. And an option to search a note would be great improvement for you."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google tasks makes technology so much simpler!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"the app is great. the tasks show up in notifications and on the calendar. Reoccurring tasks are easy to setup and manage. I wish there was an easy way to mark one instance of a reoccurring task complete in the actual app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy earning money"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"pretty neat"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good but needs to be improved, it seems google forgot about it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy to use, can share lists between people and devices"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This google app works great alongside google calendar. On the app you can add tasks with dates (that you can select to appear on Google calendar), add a description and sub tasks as well as sort them into different task folders. A really sleek design and widgets. The only thing I'd say it's not best to use it for all your tasks for everything it can get overwhelming. Great though!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice apps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Love the simplicity of the app but I do have one problem. The app really needs a search feature."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like this because it ties right into my Google calendar. I haven't figured out how to add these yet via the Google assistant. I only know how to do reminders, but those seem to be going away and these tasks taking their place. I really like that I can have different lists of tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"the only missing tool is search"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"আসসালামুআলাইকুম।"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it's very nice app to note down tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great little app to get tasks and events organised. The best part is the ability to link to emails."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Really nice app, but tags would make it nicer."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not intuitive, archaic function"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Help business"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"handy, convenient, syncs with calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The app needs more ways to re-organize, not just the created tasks, but the actual lists. Also, when a task that is to be repeated, the subtask feature disappears. It should stay on. Some more filters, labels, and categories would be helpful. If possible, progression and streaks might make the app a little more enjoyable; to help people strive for a goal."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it ❣️❣️❣️🥰❤️💯❣️❤️❤️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"just amazing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps keep things organized. And anything that I have a hyperlink for I can easily access when I need it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy to use and one of the best tools to avoid procrastination.widget is the most useful thing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I really enjoy this app. al I need is just some sound setting options to be able to hear the reminder. i cannot hear the current sound."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it's good but it should have option to attach photographs"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I hate doing tasks even if I'm the one that tells me I have to do them"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Everything is clean, but.... I personally can't receive a loud notification, like I would like to do. Maybe it's all because of OS?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very good for keeping track of one's to do list. But will be better if user can designate how many months in advanced to display. Because for tasks that are due in a year or more, will still display; I would prefer to be a user assigned as to the number of weeks or months in advance, so that the list will not get too long."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I just wish the color scheme of the phone widget was customizable, otherwise I would give it five stars."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it has too many features honestly. I wanted to make a noise at a time. Turns out i made nothing, the reminder isnt here. Do not sell my personal information."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very Nice to follow Task, due date etc. Things I felt that should be 1. search option. 2. Export to spread sheet or Excel will be more useful. 3. To fix the reminder time before the Task time. 4. Time period from ....to ..for task. Like event does 5. Go to current date or time by one click like calendar have ."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"runs my life and all my goals and systems no idea how is function with out it anymore!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Simple. Great for a to do list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"The notifications never arrive at the specific time I set them to arrive! They arrive but after 1 sometimes 2 hours! It's never stable so I need to remove it!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app I like it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I started using the Microsoft equivalent in my work, and thought the Google version would work well for my personal calendar and across my Google account. I've felt that the UI really lacks in a lot of ways compared to the MS one– sorting options on Task are limited, so you can't organize, new additions only show up at the end. only way to modify or delete a task or list is to go into each. The home screen widget is garbage, you don't have a way to jump into the app. Subtasks also show up blank."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"No way to see all tasks in all lists."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I hate it I can't stand it it's too hard to use so confusing all this is just too much to take in for anybody that doesn't have a time to go out through all of this I have a very hard time reading and to go through all of those before I get for the first two pages I don't understand it and then I just get so messed up that I can't go any farther so I have no idea how to use my phone or any of these things now it's very frustrating soon I'm just not going to have a phone because I can't do this"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Can't do a simple string filter to look for tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Hi can we have a feature where we can set a color for individual tasks. So in each list we can prioritise each tasks based on the colors. At the moment it confuses a little to find which one is the most priority task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Sometimes notifications don't show up"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Along with some of the features others have suggested, this app needs the ability to set importance and urgency"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Another app that Google is disabling on my phone..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"can't create task with Google assistant, 8t is half baked"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Where is Timely reminder."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"great but you can't share tasks with others"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I cud not set the time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesomeness"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I had an email not synchron. It was important"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This has really helped me organize my thoughts and it is very simple and easy to use. I definitely would recommend to anyone."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"sometimes I don't get notified for the task I set. I'm not sure why. I set a recurring task and it works some days and other days it simply doesn't notify me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple and amazing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"App not show reminder keep notes is good to google tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The app is clean and simple BUT !, (1) it should have more basic functions as other task app does, such as the screen/list where all tasks are and ordered by date(day view / week view) so users can view what they have to do in one screen. (2)The list should be able to be switched as user need, also able to assign color to separate list clearer. (3)There should be some settings available. The app developer should learn from To Do app (Microsoft) and make a better one!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"🤲🏼🤲🏼🤲🏼🤲🏼🤲🏼🤲🏼🤲🏼🤲🏼🤲🏼🤲🏼🤲🏼🤲🏼🤲🏼🤲🏼🤲🏼"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Needs to work with the assistant to make it more useful, but as an easy list it's OK"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"TIP! Use Google Tasks to ""brain dump"" all your to-dos, upcoming events, etc and then add them to Google Calendar so that they'll definitely get done because you've allocated time to do them! Get a sense of accomplishment after you ""tick"" off your task! Works best on your desktop for a more user-friendly experience but using your phone does the trick too. 😉"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Work made simple"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Does what it is supposed to do well...but lacks sophisticated functionality."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Is good to have a app version of that so You can just focus on creating task are your schedule. I gave 3 stars for some reasons: 1 - The web version in calendar web offer more features than the application. I believe it should be the opposite. In calendar, I can rearrang tasks, move between list and more 2 - Not able to see all your task in one place 3 - No search capabilities I'm limited to 500 words. So I hope the developper take that into consideration and include those features. Thanks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"We should be able to change the base / primary task tab. We also should have the ability to move tasks from one tab to another."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"fast, very fast"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's nice' & cute :)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I live the widget. a quick note when I don't have a pen & paper."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Just installed tonight, so this might be premature. Suggest the following: 1. Allow moving a task from one list to another. 2. Allow rearranging list names. 3. Allow manual copying from Reminders to a specific Tasks list. 4. Allow manual copying from Keep to a specific Tasks list. Noted bugs: 1. If you remove the recurring specification from a task, there is no way to add it back. 2. Assistant still stores a task in Reminders even if you tell it to store in a list in Tasks."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this task app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Used to be useless, now it's feature-rich just enough plus constantly improving."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"This app sucks compared to TasksBoard! ADVICE: You are much better off going to tasks boards on your browser of your phone then installing it as a browser app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Please add the following features. Rn the app is a shitshow. Google Keep might be better. Cannot collapse & open subtasks of a Task. Cannot add sub-tasks to sub-tasks. Think like Asana. In a Project -> Task -> Sub-Task -> Sub-task of sub-task -> steps to complete sub-sub task or the ability to add another sub task to the sub-sub task. The ability to collapse the the sub-tasks listed under a task. All of this is non-existent making it a very rudimentary tool for planning tasks and projects."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I have now installed Tasks and get a big pop-up to move my Reminders from Calendar. The transfer crashed and about half moved. I found the option in Tasks to move my Reminders manually with the following results: 1) Several Reminders are listed twice. I deleted the duplicates. Annoying, but not a big deal. 2) Almost all completed Reminders are gone. Is there a way to get these back? I had important info in some and really need it back."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. I constantly use it to manage my daily tasks. I wish there were 3 things to make it truly outstanding: 1. Google assistant integration so I can create tasks with my voice. It would be very useful especially since I am using Pixel 6 Pro 2. Ability to limit to see just tasks for today. I have so many tasks that I get overwhelmed when I see upcoming tasks for the next day too in my Google tasks widget. 3. Finally, windows app or website dedicated Fullscreen to tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Lacking some basic functionality over apps like Microsoft tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's OK. Wish it had options to put stuff under headings"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google ads for anyone to find it 🎁"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I use it coz it sinks well we every thing else I use and also it's the simplest and easiest to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Make task to show number of days"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Use this app almost every day. Writing down a to-do list is my way of freeing my mind from the things I need to do, and has been effective in getting them done when I find a suitable time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good app, but have some repeating UI elements which does pretty much the same thing, which doesn't make the app UI minimalistic and simple. For example, the entire bottom nav bar is unnecessary, just the ""+"" button could have been placed as a floating action button. Need to make simple apps for simple things, don't complicate things more than needed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very easy to use. I tried other task apps before and this is the simplest and most convenient that I've found"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love the work from the Google dev team; nothing short of perfect, as usual 👌"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it would be much better if subtasks are also allowed in repeating tasks. Please consider this suggestion."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Don't like forced updates"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It does the thing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"This apps is so basic which I really don't like. There needs to be a ui change. And also app icon is somehow so ugly in my opinion."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Tasks app is well integrated with Gmail and Google calendar. one can send an email to tasks and also assign a date due. subtasks can be add. tasks can be moved up and down in your list. And you can have more than one list, naming them anything you want. Great app; very flexible"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The problem I have with the app - and why it only got 3 stars - was that it only shows you that day's tasks rather than giving you a full timeline so you can plan your entire week. Instead, you are forced to plan a day at a time. That's a problem for me. I don't like it at all!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Garbage"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"it has no alarm feature"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"op"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Sometimes the notification doesn't show up unless you turn in the mobile"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"UI is a little clunky and movement of tasks between lists to make changes is not possible in many cases."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it would be nice if a reminder would go off"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great way to keep organized and not worry about your phone breaking and not being able to recover your notes."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"can't find a delete button so i have to feel like a liar and press complete. i think as far as functionality i like it better than to do"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works well. use it everyday. and they keep improving it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"There should be an option to assign someone or teammate/colleague"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Does so its job, but you can't edit the task when you find out you have a typo!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Can you add a function to share link with keep notes"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app ❤️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So far so good 💗❤️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"works great, would be nice to see more customizations"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The timings should be able to adjust the tasks to make make them in order"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Superb App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Very easy to use am quite comfortable with cell phones 📵"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I use this app all the time for all of the things I need to remember, and for repetitive tasks I can set a frequency."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Is there any notification to alert/notify me when the task is due for taking action"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is perfect for my to-do list needs! I also love that I can add separate widgets for different lists. Would highly recommend."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very helpfull! Hopefully this app goes for gold!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very reliable app to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not able to share the list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Why know delete?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I honestly would lose my mind without this app!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it's a worthy for remainder"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Replaces a piece of paper digitally. Great!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"its aight"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Incredible"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I really like this app, it is very helpful and easy-to-use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it's good, but could be much more better if it has some categories(tasks for different subjects)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I need to be able to press enter to make a new sub task like I can on Google keep notes"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I am still getting use to the app. Me having an ADHD mind I will happily take all the reminders that I can get."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"i know my stuff"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it! Simple and easy to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Love the organization and the widget. The only thing I wish this had was integration with Google assistant. Many times I want to add a quick item and I wish I could simply ask assistant to add it for me. I hope that's in the works!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"great for reminders for errends and appointments, easily share your daily schedule with friends and family. Hey, They may even be able to lighten your load."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It needs search. Badly. Other than that, great for having just the basics that I need - multiple lists, integration on multiple devices, due dates available but not required, and recurrence. But it needs the ability to search both individual lists and all lists. Why? Because some lists are not ToDo lists but convenient and possibly very long lists of things you might vaguely remember a week, month, or year from now. So, it's great. But did I mention it needs search?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It is missing sharing tasks list with others"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple to use, very handy."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I use this app every day! I love that you can swipe down from the top to add a wick task!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"wish Google Tasks would back up to a simple text file. and of course a disheartening lack of a search feature"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. My life is organized now :D"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Lifesaver"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's very similar in look and feel to Microsoft To-Do. The main difference, of course, is that this is for your Google account tools. Both apps are fantastic. I'd say if your company has an Exchange or Outlook server, use Microsoft To-Do for your work stuff and Google Tasks for your personal stuff."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Usage of this has helped me to be more productive with my personal time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"This app doesn't let you continue. I've tried finding my other Note app it was perfect."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"i would love the ability to subtask and repeat tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It'd be nice if you could set reminder notifications like in Google calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Would of been 5 but i cant seem to share or collaberate tasks or reminders with a friend or family member, is there perhaps something I'm missing?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"the perfect amount of minimalism!! not too time taking but still allows you so customize your tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"No complaints. Can't think of anything I'd do differently."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ok mmm m"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It works well but to make it better they should: -allow color coding -confirm deletion -save different types of ranking priorities -allow you to see lists side by side or split screen"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great way to keep track of my things. Only thing that would put it beyond expectations is a way to collaborate with others."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Really useful and simple. My favorite to do list app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is great to help me remember and complete tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I love that it can be viewed in my browser thru gmail and gdrive, so I can easily check what's on my to-do's whether I'm using my phone or a pc. Too bad it doesn't have it's own web app tho."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It is the little things that slip into the past without completion. The tasks that I have are now getting done. If not completed they are annotated. Best of all they are not forgotten."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great stuff!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Google task Reminder won't alert in oppo f5"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I have forgotten to pick up certain items from Walmart and this reminded me right before I was finished what I needed. it's amazing if you're forgetful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"❤️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It doesn't remind on time. Really creep experience with it.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good one"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good one"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Sometimes ""simple"" is the right option. Appreciate the tight integration with Gmail"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it does what I need it to do, although I was expecting it to give a little more options as far as personalization goes. But it's not given me any ryoe.of problems so 3 stars is well deserved in my opinion!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best task application ever"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The keep notes app is much better organized and does the same job of tasks what is the point of making one more app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Flexible"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and user friendly Loved it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"useful good functionality, simple and effective. has really helped with reminders and organisations"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very easy to set-up and use ......"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Asks for password entirely to many times"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very simple to use. Great for everyday to-do reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"needs a search option"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Generally good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"integrates well with GMail and Google Calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's fantastic to keep track of what you are doing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Pretty good, but could do with some more functionality and it's own desktop version, rather than only opening in Gmail"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Phenomenal Organizational Timesaver! I've been using it for many years and I love that I have the option to have things auto transfer to my Google Calendars. I have many different lists and it really helps me keep things organized."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"really worth it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like everything about the app so far but the fact that reminder is only a notification, can't y'all add an alarm notification since a Normal notification can easily be mistaken for a non important notification"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I use Tasks everyday on both iOS and Android to keep track of appointments I have coming up as well as ToDoLists and just have notes on ideas."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Useful and simple. But I wish you could share lists with other people to collaborate on. Colour coding would be great too"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, simple and straightforward."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like it, I just wish I could access it on my computer as well as my phone. Update: This feature is now available through Gdrive. Thanks for this!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"makes life easier"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best app for managing tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"easy and free"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app, interfaces with calender well. Just wish there was a more useful desktop version so I can manage things on there. Could also use labels on starred tasks to show what category they're from, and ordering tasks of the same category one after the other in starred tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"much needed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Beautiful, simple and easy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Use the edit icon to pin, add or delete clips. Doggle may be required for Bluetooth from Outsourced USB or AmazonAWS Storage Not clip cylces or Microsoft Azure Cloud dats. IBM Watson _drivers available. Format Prodigy Compuserve HRBlock Lt District Support Staff associate and Messenger Lead Pasadena CA"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"useful but interface is rather confusing"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"very easy to write different type of to do list, notification features are also good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Still to make use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Should add more options,like snooze, floating notification etc"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google tasks is an essential tool for those of us who aren't able to remember a lot at one time. My favorite feature is that I can enter my tasks on my computer, but they show up on my phone as well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"simple, effective way to manage todos."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So far, it has been quite helpful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"i think using some colours according to the importance of tasks be better define."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The feature that lets you link emails to tasks is extremely helpful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"hard to access the full list from the widget"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Need More Options Like Calender View and Many More"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The recurring tasks just don't work reliably. Several of these don't show up in spite of setting up properly."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Useful app, no bells or whistles, but it does the job."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I use it daily. It is easy and helps me not feel forgetful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Stop asking for feedback"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I would love some colour coding and a priority check"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Incredible app, and can be seen on google calendar too! Thanks Google!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"👍♥️😃"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"structural would be nice to add"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"There could be better UI to organise lists like Microsoft To Do"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good and works well, automatically syncs with Google. But lacks the ability to create lists within a task and the ability to set a reminder before a tasks due date"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Minimalistic and awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"very helpful for reminders and organizing my bills"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I love how simple the interface is for task management. Would be 5 stars, however I wish the devs would allow the lists to be rearranged in any order. Currently, the order in which the lists are created determines their position. I would like to rearrange my lists freely and put the most used lists near My Tasks. Rearranging could be as simple as press, hold and drag similar to apps on our home screens."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"too much love"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is such an amazing app. Helps me priotise my tasks is a very efficient way. Very simple yet very reliable."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works great to keep myself from falling behind on the smaller (often forgotten) household chores."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"great stuff"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I recommend they enable voice commands to add tasks in Android Auto"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple UI that provides exactly what you need. Excellent Task management I use almost daily."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"useful for reminders, as intended. nothing more, nothing less"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Productive app. Thanks!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Poor widget, no undo possible for misclick. It"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very handy to organise my day projects. I do like that you can create tabs to split your task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very efficient"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Why exactly I need this app? To ruin my existing tasks in calendar? In which way this app makes my life better? I couldn't find anything..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Wanna noodle my poodle?🤓"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Can't search for a task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Many times notification is not coming.please develop this situation."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It helps me to manage my day-to-day activities and checklist, it's a good app to have.👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Sometimes the reminders/notificationd are a little late, but the app works fine otherwise"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent 👌"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"perfect"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"it would be nice if could create tasks using Google Assistant"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"help keep everything tracked, I integrates great with calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Does everything you need to do with no frills (which is good)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good App!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is great for keeping track of my errands and to-do projects."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app, just missing the posibility of a view for all the tasks around different lists."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent application"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"cannot re orginize tasks group taps .. can not change task group if it is a recurring task .. task alarm is useless should be louder and more interrupting"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"missing more robust productivity tracking features but it does the job for simple to do list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Simple and functional. Some small annoyances, like you can't rearrange lists on mobile."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I wish it had an alarm like feature and better notifications"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love it, specially I can see tasks in calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Extremely useful app. Does what it should, straightforward and no frills."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"it has everything"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Pretty basic, but does the job."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"helps keep me organized and on track to get things done"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I use tasks for multiple things to stay organized. I love that it works with calendar. However, it would be so much better if I could put lists in the order I want"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"need ⏰ alarm and pictures to save"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please Add a section of progress percentage covered so far Day wise or list wise with a widzet too showing this % . It is of utmost requirement these days ."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"AWESOME TOOL"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's great to have a reminder of things."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very useful 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"how did I not know about this sooner!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"no web app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very helpful, keeps me on tasks and shows up on Google calendar!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"if the tasks could appear on the google calendar on the phone, that would be helpful. currently they do appear on the google calendar when i view it on my computer."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works really well"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app to track your to do list. Updating repeating tasks is a little inconvenient as it requires you to delete the task and great a new one. Apart from that I've had zero issues"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"simple, free, no adds. the only thing that would make it better is integration with the Google assistant! it's my GTD tracking system."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It is easy to use and very helpful. Google Tasks is a great tool."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Excellent, useful app. Could use some tweaks to run better on Chromebook."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"super easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"4 because this really need the possibility of move the lists, and change the order"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Just love it 😊. For Long time I was expecting some kind of Application with Google calendar like this. Hare it is❤️."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I LOVE IT"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"opna"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Yes sir Ji"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very cool, I'm always making all sorts of list, on the computer and bits of paper, often lost or forgotten; perhaps I can keep track of them with this. 🙂"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Its pretty good. When we mark the task as completed, If we can see the completed dates it will be really great 👍. Further pls include and update the task input dates too. Then we can see the incompleted duration for the relevant tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Poor App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Only ONE problem - widget can't be resized to lets say 2x2 or 2x3, depending what layout you use on homescreen, that is how you can resize it, but NO 3x2 for example. Help??"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"As much as its simplicity it's pretty good, with its syncing with Google calendar ....just perfect 🔥🔥❤️❤️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Too little too late. Clunky"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It is simple and easy to use but i wish that there is a widget feature or something that will work out with the lock screen. In addition, insuggest that you include checklist checkbox since it's is a task application."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This app is very useful and having all the required features. I'm enjoying. One request to add the snooze and delete option when it is notifyed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Where is it for PC?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"No way to move the order of your lists, or group them. I like ti use a lot of lists and it's impossible to do with this app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Shockingly bad app. Like a high school senior project or something. I think Google can do a little bit better. I guess they had that on their Todo list but didn't follow through. Of course."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Kuch task complete hone pe points. Ka bhi section add kar do jisse or maja aaye or accha lagaga by the way I am also experienced software engineer i know c c++ dsa full stack django i am in 1st semester"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good app for taks management. I do wish that repeating tasks would show up again after you've completed one. It works this way in Google calendar, but in the Tasks app they disappear into the ""Completed"" section."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"A suggestion to include a division in the list of things you need to do today vs things you need to do some other day"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Please group main list and sub lists..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Missing Wear OS support"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I was looking for. To-do list with the option to add deadline (date & time). Best part is, since it is linked with my google account, I can see my list on any platform like on the desktop app or the mobile app. I can even view it via a chrome extension. Amazing."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"অঅঋএএ"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like it's simplicity but we should be able to rearrange the order of tasks manually."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Google developers should know for themselves the word developers. This app really sucks in comparison to Micorosft's To do app. To be specific they should redesign tab or add the tab that allow user to see all task from different categories without the need to look each one of them. Just gather idea on MS To Do app on planned task category to see my point very clear."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Update: My mobile Google calendar shows my task. I'm giving Google task another try and the improved features may make using the app a convenient and productive product. Good app for tracking your to do list. But I would like to see it integrated with the Google calendar app and not just the web calendar. This would be helpful for viewing all tasks in one location and provide the flexibility to set completion dates and view on my mobile calendar not just when at my PC."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It doesn't allow setting of different notification sounds for each different task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Useless. For the biggest company in the world, this app has the imagination of a start-up. Zero versatility compared to most others. Uninstalled within 10 mins."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Okay"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's mine always have the same thing that I am so much better person who can help me with any questions please"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Repeat Option issue : Once repeat disable cannot enable why?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app to work with"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Positive wow factor 100%"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and useful, great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Dear Developer, Please do not off Google Tasks application icon badge until work is marked as completed. Right now we I clear notifications, icon badge also goes off."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Pretty much utterly featureless. No support for different types of tasks like shopping lists. Not even any support for recurring tasks. Updating this review a year later to say it's no better. It's still garbage. This has less features than just writing reminders on my arm with a sharpie. Updating this two years later to say they have still added exactly zero features. I am in awe that google can only manage to scrape together the absolute bare minimum in quality for something so simple."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Needs following views / sections - Today, Tomorrow, All, Completed & bin."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Vey nice app. I always forget to charge my phone, so after installing this app, I never let my phone battery percentage go below 40%."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I appreciate the help from my Google assistant app in combination with this app. I struggle to focus and this helps me put the worm in my ear that I need to do things. 😍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"You can just combine Keep and Tasks, and make a well functioning app, you know?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not able to download"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Doesn't allow you to set duration for tasks so it is shown in calendar. This is a very much needed feature."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It is very complicated. Does not show the column where to enter the activity, date and time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Fantastic option, getting rid of writing down need to do's on note pad's or slip's of papers !!??"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"87 enuuj"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Simply good when connected to the internet, but doesn't work offline. Notifications should also be heard from the phone's speaker when connected to bluetooth handset."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Mixes the order of the tasks and doesn't regularly sync with the calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Regional restrictions. Thanks google for not providing anymore."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Too easy to use and too helpfull for me...I easily forget things which I had to do but this app reminds me..I mean this app is totally same according to my use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good but i need list of repeat activity for tommorow on this day not after 00:00"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Can't move lists around. This app is so unnecessarily limited"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Where is the App? I need to go to PLAYSTORE and it asked if I want to open it. But it is not listed with my other Apps in my phone?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Me gustaría que las listas de tareas se puedan compartir con otros usuarios de google"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"About PLE Tests"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very nice app and easy to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Feedback - please add these 2 features! 1. Can move order of lists. Now if I make a new list it's stuck at the end... 2. Improve widget: swipe up or down on empty space to move from list to list instead of having to tap at the top of the widget and then select a list to change."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps me to not forget to reply to emails."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Please add category option list option as microsoft todo, one thing i noticed is that after creating subtaks and completing them it impossible to know which was completed for which task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent app👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Need to be improved."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"We can't use it in our country. Why?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I really like this task manager since I used some before but I wish Google task would keep the notification up on the Notification bar until you went into the app and clicked completed or not it would just stay up tbere. Feel like that would be very helpful for people that might see it but forget since they ended up swiping the notification off. Overall very good app keep it up"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Eu nunca quis sumir as pessoas é que me duvidaram"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and clean. It includes a handy widget."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The app does what it's supposed to do and it works well 🤩"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I'm sure my husband and I will stay on track."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good apps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Mindy!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Perfect app to use with Google ecosystem"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"lovely performance"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's easy to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"App is good. Nice UI. Task scheduling is easy. It would be nice if there was another list that contains all the upcoming tasks within a week or so from other user-created list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Needs integration with Google assistant"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"never gives notifications omg please don't install this over calendar it's so horrible and the UI is pure garbo"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Among Us"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Update 9/1/22: still waiting to have repeating tasks immediately renew instead of showing up on the day that they are next due. It's hard to plan my day the night before when there's a bunch of tasks that I don't yet know about because Google waits till midnight . Very functional for heavy use. My only request is to immediately renew repeating tasks. I think I don't have much going on tomorrow and am shocked when all the repeating tasks that I couldn't see the night before have appeared."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"What a waste of effort in making this app only half way. Why can't I share a list with somebody and we both check things off of it together? Isn't it 2022? People nowadays have greater expectations from apps, especially when there is a big company behind them. It's not like you don't have the resources to make it properly."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ok good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"wow"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I love this app but I really feel that a lot of the new updates are taking away from the ease of functionality that made this app so good. Also, I'm having a lot of sync problems - tasks getting duplicated, not synchronizing between the mobile app and desktop etc. This is only a new thing for me but is very frustrating and taking a lot of time for me to double and triple check it. Very annoying that updates to a lot of Google apps of late are just breaking the app - be better at testing Google."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Yeah, but do I really want to share my entire life with another US corporate....?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"GREAT"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Simples até demais! Falta criar uma forma de poder agrupar as listas de tarefas em um lugar só (como um grupo de listas). Pois, quanto mais listas são criadas, mais complicado fica de achar e organizar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Eye change"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"can't reach tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good Application"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It needs to let you add other people to a task, or even assign them to someone else. There's basic things like subtasks and setting a recurring function, but there's Microsoft to do that just offers that and way more"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I request to show count after list heading same like it is appearing with completed section. This will be helpful to see how many task anyone has in a single eye view. Thanks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps you see everything you're doing and get organized."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Option should also be given to change notification sound alert. This needs to be updated."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Sometime I don't get the notification of some tasks . Please fix it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this App SO much. Love the UI and UX design. Mostly, this App helps me to build healthier self-esteem. This App certainly deserves 5 stars. :)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Subtasks are not displayed on the widget, and there is no way to launch the full app from the widget either. This means that instead of one tap on my homescreen, I need to open the app drawer, find the Tasks app, and tap the subtask from there. Please, fix those two things, it would make this app much better."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I only use this because it's easy to sync in my computer from my phone"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Update: repeating tasks do now reappear, although not as soon as the most recent one is completed. Still rate 1 star because push notifications for repeating tasks do not always come through, very inconsistent- only works by reopening the app daily. This means I have missed some important reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Why does this app not come bundled with the Android, it is such a helpful option!!!!!!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Hey good but neglected Google app that does not integrate with Google Assistant. I really wish there was an integration to add tasks to a list via voice commands."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"There should be an interface to change list order. and an option to change colour of reminder notifications bar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I want to learn to use auto-cad in drafting school"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Your to do list!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Notifications either don't show or shows much later than set time..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I'd have liked to see a single section showing all my scheduled tasks for the day. Also, there should be an option to make the notifications persistent till the task is completed or snoozed."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"👋 👋 👋 👋"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use, no ads in regular usage. Simple. Good."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"It doesn't have alarm to awaken to do the work"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"One of the best for productivity"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Need More features like Any do application"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping track of life to do list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple & easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, and straight forward"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Simple use and very useful app to organise daily or weekly repeating activities."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Please put alarm. I'll give 5 stars for the alarm"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very handy for notes"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best app to organise daily tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It made my day simple"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great, thanks Google."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Efficient and Useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Feeling that I am in the process of getting organized without me having to go through clear reminders forget about all of the first time now and then ill make sure to never forget about my well-being in the future."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good and quite useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It is a good app. I am missing default ""today list""."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Remind me to get things done"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app, i love how i can easily create and check off tasks through the widget Which works wonderfully for my uses as i don't want to load up a bulk app just to add a simple thing on my mind at that moment. Also if I do need to open the application itself it loads quickly and is very simple UI so i can do what I want with ease"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple. Allows me to enter my tasks, set due dates and order them in the order I want them."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Love this app, just wish I could create a new task in Google calendar without a specific date assigned to it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Takes some learning at first as to how the app works, eg Label Headings Sub tasks etc but getting use to it. So far it's fine for shopping list, reminders, calender type use that doesn't grab contacts, which is good."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love it, it keeps me organized"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I don't understand why this needs to be a seperate app than *Google Calendar"" or ""Google Keep""which lets you create lists, notes, reminders and tasks. It's completely unnecessary. It seems like Google's motto is to create as many apps as possible and flood the market with their products without considering if it can be incorporated into one of their many already existing products."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Switching from apple to Android, I needed a way to create to do lists but I love this even more! I use it for grocery lists, reminders, and to do lists."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good but it doesn't help remind me to do it I would like if there was a better way to remind but other wise I love it it help be more organized"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Has two major deficiencies: (1) there is no way to change the default so that all lists are ordered alphabetically, and (2) there is no way to back up the lists so that they are not forever lost if one's cell phone is misplaced or stolen."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Really good!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Please Include some coloured themes"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use task scheduler"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Pretty good."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very well organized."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent app helps in staying organised with your scheduled tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It needs to visually change so I don't somehow mark tasks as completed as soon as I create them. Otherwise great, thanks peeps."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Need an alarm and reminder multiple times"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Tasks have total functionality and provide flexibility"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great job 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Wonder"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I like the app but wish it was easier to have collaborative lists etc."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"App is very helpful for doing tasks on time"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"All experience..i knows.i am ex"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"What would I add is a capability of not just removing the completed tasks, but also lighting them up with gray to see what I've done"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like the fact that it's on my phone and to the right in my Gmail account on my computer. As a businessman with ADHD, I can now keep track of all the ideas I get and eventually follow through on them."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is one of my most used apps. It does everything I need it to do and keeps me from falling apart."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Just began so currently 50/50"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this app!!!! Organization is critical in my life and at work. Google Tasks makes staying on track a piece of cake."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Rely on this app as my personal aide for reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Such a helpful tool. I love the feature that allows to move the tasks around different lists. Will be even better with following features 1) Color code on each task. Filter by color. 2) Rearrange the list of lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great App, does everything it needs too and more. Love how effortless it is to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Make tasks repeatble daily, with ability to check off for the day"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Keeps me updated in my agenda"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best task and list app ever"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I use this everyday for work and home. Great for making to-do lists without having to bother with Google Calendar. Wishlist: incorporation into Google Assistant (how is this not implemented yet?); Location based reminders; Undo/redo buttons; Shared/ collaborative lists for teams; Smoothing out UI for desktop browser interface (especially for subtask creation: existing merely as a minor tab in Gmail isn't that great)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Easy and straightforward. However, that is also where its weakness lies, very little extra or practical options (like subcategorization etc)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It would be nice if I could move tasks from one list to another without recreating them. Also, when a recurring task is completed and marked as such for the first occurrence, I would like to see the task reappear as needing to be completed with the details of the next occurrence (i.e. next date to be completed). Instead, it sits in the list of completed tasks. If it weren't for the fact that the tasks link with my calendar and can be viewed properly there, I would be using a different app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Easy to use UI. Excellent integration with Google services (Gmail, calendar, chat). Sorting could be better. Would love to see labels and natural language processing for time added to the feature list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Solid lists app, best one I've found so far. A simple search function would take it to 5 stars."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I've only been using this for a few days but in this short amount of time I've found this app to be extremely well organized and easy to operate. I give it a 4.5 only because the interface is a tad boring. It could use some color, different fonts, imported pics or something else that's visually appealing. Otherwise, this app is perfect (so far)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simplistic yet intuitive."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Wouldn't be able to live without this app. Super user friendly. Love that they have sub tasks. Is there a way to add a ""sub sub task""? Like a sub task under a sub task?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good ."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best app ever"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Love that it is integrated with gmail and and all our google products. I wish it had the option of viewing all tasks in a single list as well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I deleted it after trying it, my tablet doesn't let me delete tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for years. It is so convenient for any list I need to make."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Helps me keep organized"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Convenient to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app for my to dos, both work and personal. Also use it for checklist to make sure I remember to get everything I need for when I go to events. Syncs perfectly between my phone and my Google Workspace."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very, useful and user friendly!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Simple and non invasive"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Only one by update save"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Best ToDo, Organiser & Tasks app from Google. Search Button To Be Added For Seaching In Google Tasks. Thanks & Regards."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The app can have a collaboration model with other people. For eg if someone ispreparing for an event, the checklist can be shared to others so that all can track the progess. Its available in microsoft to do"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice app, Google improve this app time to time."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I really don't know what i would do with out it fantastic"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app helps me keep track of what I am doing and there is only so much you can improve with a reminder app but the are little glitches that happen like the app forgetting to notify me or it saving."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Good but something along the lines of 'reminders' would work better if included as an option rather than simply 'tasks'."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Pretty good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great App. Easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Keep up with what i suppose to do"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Md jashim uddin good laike apps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent what i want i got it ... easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's functional, but I wish recurring tasks allowed subtasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Does the job well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Fun."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I do like that I can have columns with tasks in different parts of my life. I like that I can star them and see those in a separate list. I wish I could move the ones on the starred list to change the order manually. That is the one thing I need. I've been looking for an app that will do that. Thank you for your work."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So helpful in my managing thing for my life and job"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Better than calendar notifications and I like the list options. Wish you could add links or attachments to tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It is really helpful, I am still exploring it as I just start. I will update my comment and let you know more later. But for right now it helpful for me, because it allows me to create tasks and remind me of it. As it is a link to my Google account I can have it connect to my schedules and other Google stuff."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good, but would be nice to be able to reorder tasks like in the web"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and modify"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Was using Keep Notes for my task purposes but this is much better. Also has fully functional widget. Love it. 100× better then those cluttery add ridden To Do apps."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So far so good."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice app really like it!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A brilliant way to stay organized and productive! With a simple interface, it's easy to navigate and manage all your tasks!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Simple app that works well!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"My favourite app for the last two years"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Still no material u?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great, only one complaint I would like it if the reminders i add in tasks would sync up with google calendars"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Get day together better."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Easy to use but would be better with ability to copy and paste task list"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Ummm, stupid"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Pretty good. Would be better if, on my mobile, I could slide the lists left and right to change the order they appear. Can you fix this?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this app❤️❤️❤️"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The widget is what works for me very well for noting down things that need to be done"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Pretty good, could be a little less tricky with setting times. I may be too used to google calender but I think Google calender is easier to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and works very well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very useful,Great app,Thanks..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It is helpful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love this tool."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps me keep my to do, gratitude, and goals lists all in one place! I love it!!😍😍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love Google but I really need to talk to them about some problems that I've had with something security Google and it may not be your fault I think it's the manufacturers of the phones fall the people are getting into people's accounts easy all you have to do is go up under the phone to emergency and then it unlocks the door damn"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very simple"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very handy keeps me organised"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's good. It could benefit from more features."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"amazing wllh"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice for business owners"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love this app! Makes it easy to categorize and share!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very cool. Making routines now."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to schedule"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use keeps me reminded until completed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Ok dark theme,.... Long time no update... is it google app ?..wonder !!! In this version,When editing, the ""tick mark"" near delete bin icon is confusing always of finish editing or completed task. Everytime I am wrongly using and undo."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"pretty much has most of my notes."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Can we have 1. Ability to collapse subtasks 2. Colour code items (or categories atleast)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Super helpful for me to prioritize my tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Task assignment should be there in tasks to make it more collaborative."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Require widget transparency"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good, but it needs to be able to function with Google voice command. Example, ""OK google, add a task"" and it will add into a default task list where you can edit it later. This would be beneficial if you don't have the phone/computer with you but you have other google devices, or when your hands are busy (cooking, driving, hiking etc.)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The app is really good for a to do list or as a task manager. One recommendation is that to add a swipe and delete task feature. Right now i have to go on each and every single completed task and delete them manually. Having so many completed task feels like a mess."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"V easy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"To early to rate"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Need more basic features. Like that is a Google product. I will love to have it integrated to Google Keep. If I notice this is a task that needs to be elaborated then send it to Keep. Or if I need to send collaboration i can do it in the app and not to go to chat and the tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Get some more functionality, learn from Microsoft to do"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Fine"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I use it every day. The calendar integration is my favorite feature!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Is helping me better accomplish things no more mental notes or post it notes still have much to work on but a very resourceful and helpful daily tool"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"In case of a long task, the widget must show the full task, instead it shows one line with a couple of ... Other than that this is a 5 star app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Convenient to use. Easy to operate. Fulfills my needs."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good one"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very Helpful to keep me on track"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So far so good 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Cancel not at this time financial reasonable."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple, easy to use. Just wish we could integrate Tasks as a whole better into gmail"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Takes care of my light work so I can focus and stay organized on goals and every thing that gets thrown in my path on daily basis."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Neat app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Amazing App...Increases my Productivity"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"works really well. satisfying when marking tasks as completed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love this app so easy to put reminders down so I never forget"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good, clean app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Lacks so many useful features"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Okay, but would like a touch ability to sort the tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great Cross-platform App. This meets my simple needs for tomorrow lists."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this app, wish I knew about it sooner."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and user friendly"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like this app but I wish it would time stamp the task when it was completed. I like to remind myself of when I get things done."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It does what it's supposed to for me and track tasks. I like how it's integrated into Google calendar. Area for improvement is to add the ability to assign tasks to family members (Identified Google Family)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"fantastic app for one with compromised memory"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Have only used it for a few days, but I like it so far. Very simple, but lots of ways to customize."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Keeps me on track"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Not for recurring tasks at all. When you complete a recurring task then it doesn't show up again until the very next day that it is due. This makes planning impossible and defeats the entire purpose of a todo list. When you complete a task it should instantly create and show the next instance but it doesn't. I found many forums of people talking about the issue with no response from Google"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"No integration with Google calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"how can ""google"" do this???? a new task gets added at the top??? that's pathetic! i am going back to using keep as my task manager."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very Useful App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very good memories tital for future."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Nice but need more improvement"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Mindblowing helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Awesome for getting things completed, however there's a breakdown of functionality between phone and PC. When I set an email as a task on my phone and click view task, it directs me to a google webpage with a 400 error"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I use this app every day - one feature i would love is the ability to pin tasks to the top of the list! Thanks team"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is an easy, simple app to use. Everything works just fine."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Keeps me organized"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I love how simple and fast this app is. To make it better, imo, monthly calendar style format would be great to remember the tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Does not allow you to delete a portion of the text..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Have been using around a month. Helps me to stay organized. Like the ability to schedule tasks + specific sub tasks. If past due, they show as pending."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's very easy to use and convenient"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very useful complement to Google Calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Still trying to figure out how to best use this app. In general it's a good idea but it certainly doesn't solve my procrastination issues 😁"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great for individual not so much collaboration. Would be nice to create a shared shopping list or task list of chores to share with Google Family members. Could literally have it on like a Nest Hub and show assigned tasks. So much potential, just not there."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I use the widget to add to do items and quick reminders on my home screen. Very quick and convenient."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"There is isn't a way to show progress on one day if several day task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This app is great for simple organization, however. There should be a priority setting feature where you can organize tasks based on their level of importance. It will be easier to view tasks and complete them if they are organized this way."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good app for organising your day to day"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Wonderfully simple and extremely easy to use regularly. Widget is the winning feature for it's simplicity and ease of use. Only gripe is lack of integration with Outlook and other apps for simplicity and would also appreciate automatic reminders or morning brief of pending tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Keeps me on 'Task' 😁"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Simple task list with sub-tasks easily gets the job done"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"There is definitely room for improvement. Recently I have started using this more and I can see more bugs with this app. Although I have task set for 26th it shows as 27th in my tasks list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Love the integration with Google Calendar. Hope the tasks can be color-coded as well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good app for making list of all meetings and reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Reusing established lists isn't as smooth as it could be and having sub categories would be helpful but otherwise it's great. I use it daily."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Useful App."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"OK."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent, never missed out any work."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps organize my forgetful brain"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's good, nice and simple, honest. It's useful having it connected to my Google account and accessible and synched on multiple devices. I found it easier to login to than the Microsoft one. 1 star less because it lacks a bit of something (can't quite place it - maybe that's not fair of I don't know what it is, but...)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Well designed, easy to use."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, no ads, friendly and helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I'm so satisfied from this app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Amazingly good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's a useful app, but if Tasks and Keep Notes were integrated into the Gmail app that would be an organizational tool I would pay money for."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Phantaasticcc!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Brilliant app i ever found i always believe on Google's product. It's team, leader and improvement always gives a massive feel and surprise|| no words to say it has everything we need but in my gap is 'search' there is no search system to find task and category...."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Integrates nicely with my Google calendar, which I love. But I want to be able to rearrange my lists. Colors would be great also. The Google calendar has colors, so should Tasks so that everything matches up."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is great for reminding yourself to do something, you can have multiple lists to keep it organised too."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I will come back to this before the end of the indian summer ends in my geographical area of physical existence nowadays. Thanks for useful apps and info to all of us trying to be as natural as and smart as possible!! Love and sustainability will happen soon enough for those who believe in me without making me famous. Thanks. 20220822RA15:01No(rway time)"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A great app to all those productive guys out there and a great tool to schedule your day and also reduces procastinations"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works great!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"5/5 from me If their was a dark mode for the widget"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice simple app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please add attachments option"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good except numbering would help"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Me encanta! La uso para todas mis tareas repetitivas, mensuales normalmente."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simplicity is great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Good GUI."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So for everything I was looking for"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good now"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"गुड"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great application. Thank you for your work!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I love this app but i am just sad that you can't customize the widget! Why sticking to only only one theme? Could you issued this?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The app is easy to use. But it shows 7AM reminder at 10PM. Fix it Google."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple, doesn't hog resources, does what it's supposed to do and more if you're creative. Aside from tasks you could use it to track cash, schedule and so on."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Me encanta porque es sencilla y sirve para lo que quiero, tal vez agregar la opción de que se queden fijas las tareas que editamos y que aparezca la hora de la creación, gracias"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"WHY DOES THIS APP NOT HAVE GOOGLE ASSISTANT INTEGRATION"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Satisfied"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Simple task app that's fine for one off lists but falls short on reoccurring tasks. After the first instance of a a reoccurring task, it won't show up on the task list until the day it's due, so you don't see it coming. So reoccurring tasks are worthless."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google should develop a dedicated project management tool for their workspace clients atleast. It's a much needed application."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Got to love old G-tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very Helpful for me.....I was searching such type of apps... Thanks Google....of possible kindly provide ""search option"" in it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app Loved it a lot..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"UI Interface could be made better"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very useful and it was my first time for keep tracking lists of the best one"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Make the day more easier than ever. Thanks alotssas"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Works better than Assistant Reminders, and is actually not tied to a useless assistant app. Only thing is a weird bug when setting a reminder to repeat for 2 days in a row, the ending date shows completely different dates and weeks compared to the starting date (as well as the calendars looking different for some reason)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I use it to function! Can't live without it. Suggestion - a provision to search for tasks from within the app, instead of having to go on calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's the best app I've ever used."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Simple and no nonsense. I wish there were better integration with Google Assistant, but otherwise, it's very handy to have the task list available anywherebI'm logged into Google."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It would have been better if I can synchronize task to certain event in google calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I love how goals in calendar would determine the best time in my calendar for my goals and it let me set a time frame, ie: 30 min, 1 hour, etc. I loved the Windows phone, it did more than Google, but Google was starting to get as useful and easy to use as Windows. Now Google is taking away everything that made it almost as good as Windows."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works very well. Lots of flexibility."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Task list but no useful reminder !! No alarm or pop-up !!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and very helpful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy simple, cant see on google calendar but I'm now not that bothered."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best, Lost for words"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"It can have many features like any other local app, i should be able to filter today's task, next 3 days task, completed task... Widget feature need to be improved a lot..Please refer many local apps for better idea.. Eg: business task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Needs some simple improvement and it will be perfect"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Needs to be searchable and have a Trash can and undelete function"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I have autism, so similar to some people with ADHD I need lists to help me keep track of everything I need to get done and to help prioritize my time. Google Tasks lets me do that with the ability to make multiple lists and to star my most important tasks. It also syncs up with my Google calendar which is very helpful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use! Very straightforward!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Exceptional app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Get all your tasks done on time brilliant for me!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It is free, easy, and uncluttered. There are plenty of additional features that could be added, but it is a great start."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Really great app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use. I was taking notes on keep earlier, now this one is more preferred for short notes."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I hope task can have more format or folder to more detailed separation of task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"The push notifications dont work well. Sometimes I get push notifications an hour later or only when I unlock my phone... So if you are looking for an app to remind you about tasks, avoid this! I almost ran out of time for a task because of this..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Useful and integrated with calendar in Android"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Solid app that works and ties together your Gmail and calenders appointments and tasks. Every update brings more functionality!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good App."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good experience. I use it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It would be nice if the lists could slide in preference order"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app is so easy to use. It's perfect for organizing my to-do lists and noting things I need to remember"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love using task for quick easy organized list. I love that sub task can have due dates to. The only thing missing is be able to attach pictures. So for certain projects I then use GNotes."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Use this every day"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"goood"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"IT WOULD BE A 5 STAR REVIEW if when deleting tasks they didn't also delete the history of deleted tasks. For example it asks ""delete all past and future occurrences?"" Instead of giving options to just delete the current recurring task for the day, for a week or just the current and all future tasks. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE HISTORY OF MY TASKS rather than delete them when I'm deleting a recurring tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Application is superb. If possible give an option to check task has been completed with completed date."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Im leaning more about how to delete old or no longer needed Messages'from my Tasks and this app are much more pravite."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"No ads which is good, I suggest integration with Google Assistant, like you can ask the assistant to create tasks, similar to reminders"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app. Access it in Gmail on the web. Needs better integration with assistant"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps balance my day"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"very practical and useful tool to help better prioritize, organize."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Tasks is a decent app with one major drawback. That being, if I create a task that needs to have subtasks, I can't create it as a *repeating* task, which means I either have to use a tasks app that allows repeating tasks with subtasks or create separate tasks for each subtask, which is less effecient. Easily fixed, but Google has seen fit not to add this feature. Otherwise a decent tasks app that integrates nicely with other Google apps."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works for me 🙂"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Keep track of documents"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very smooth and clean"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Easy to use. Quick scheduling and reminder of tasks to be done."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"So far I really like the layout and functionality of the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"please add some color coding for the tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I just started using this app about 5 minutes ago, so I don't have a full experience upon which to rate it. It seems okay, so I will give it a safe 3. I am not a techie, or programmer. My hope is that for important needs such as classes, meetings, apts, and the like, I can coordinate between the calendar, my task list, and maybe gmail, so that I dont have to open each in order to save things. If I still have to use individual apps in the same application profile, it will be useless."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I mainly use the check lists. Very helpful!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This app is really usefull for students"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great for tracking to do's"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Exceptional"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Pretty good app, missing official Desktop app version."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Needs search function within app and needs bullet points option"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"BEST APP TO MAKE STUDY PLANNER"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Just starting to use this app. It's helping track my progress through complex actions. It's working, and I'm usimg it more and more."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Amazing 👏"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Nice app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"A nice and simple list app that does what it claims to be. Developers should try adding an option to share tasks with people and add a facility to exchange messages and replies with attachments between the people."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Still improving. Task assigments and task sharing would get 5 stars."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Appreciate it for being user friendly. Would be good if it synchronised with Google drive. But generally a good app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Superb and lovely, just what I needed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Useful and smooth but better integration with calendar would be great, also if you could pull a list directly from email text that would be awesome. Does what it says and what it should though"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Can there be a feature where people assigned tasks can be notified by e-mail?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Super simple easy to use, but still with the best interface!!!! Outstanding work by Google!!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I was using this one and it was good. But this does not have a app that I can install on my Mac book. Using through web is less comfortable. Only for that reason I'm shifting to Microsoft To Do. It has apps in both my android and my Mac Book."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good luck"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"the best app i ever used, so easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great, but I wish there was a setting to keep in notification bar until marked complete. That way clearing notifications won't dismiss the alert"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very handy app 😊 Saves me the stress of doing this on paper."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good apps. Recommended to use it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Only just using after 2 years. Struggling a little..8"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple, functional"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Where. Has. This. Been All My Life?!? Ive been using Google Keep as my to do list and I hated it. During a webinar someone was reviewing Google calendar and mentioned tasks -- I'd heard of it in passing but never took the time to check it out since the app wasn't native to my phone. Oh my goodness, this was everything I wanted out of Keep and more. I cried happy tears upon using it for the first time (for context - I'm a working grad student and parent...so I think the tears are justified)."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple, reliable, free"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I use this as my daily todo planner. Works well and does what I need."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good so far."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works great and reminds me of things I've committed to"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very satsfied with the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"No comparison to MS ToDo. Do Larry Page and Sundir pachi use this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It is so helpful to create tasks directly from a chat or email! It would be nice to change the color of them on tbe calendar like events."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great integration with calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Please create companion app for wearos"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and Easy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use. Provides a very basic and streamline function of creating tasks, reoccurring tasks and reminders. I'm able to sync my tasks with other members in my family which is very convenient so we can stay up to date on one another's weekly schedule."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Suggestion: 1) Add Google shopping list to it. 2) Add sticky notes 3) Task Tracking 4) More widgets"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This reminds my tasks thanks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"You Guys are Fabulous!!!!. A wonderful and great Asset and blessing to the entire Community!!!. Cordially, CPL Soto"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Pretty functional for a free app It would be great if it had a way to prioritize tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, and allows for different types of tasks, reminders, and repeat settings."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"This task app now is integrated into Google calendar. You can keep the date blank or add a date and/or time. If you do, it will add it to your calendar and remind you. It allows you to sort wither chronologically or in an order you choose. You can now add several tasks at once."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Although Google Tasks has less features than a lot of other task list apps it makes up for it with it's tight integration with Gmail and Google Calendar. Features I'd like to see introduced in future are better handling of subtasks and more advanced filtering options for long task lists."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I am happy Google Taskas app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's alright I kept a widget to remind me and look at it but maybe some new details can improve so satisfy people"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's extremely useful! A great help if you want to stay organized and manage your tasks and goals well."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It's a very usable in terms of just being a task management app, however the main reason I downloaded this overy any other phone task manager is because it's by Google. I was hoping that since they made this app, at the very least there'd be good integration between this app and google assistant! It would be so much more convenient to be able to use this app alongside google reminders via assistant. Giving 3 stars as I expected this integration at the very least. Hope you update soon! Thank you."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I wish I could share a list with others so they could add to it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I make tasks. I get dopamine from being able to check them off. Is good."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"More than great. And it's even better if you connect it to the google calendar app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Legit I like it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Terribly simple."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Finally a task app I can use. Why isn't it available in GMAIL?! What What I need is outlook tasks without the rest of the app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Need to be able to transfer tasks from folder to folder"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and effective, connected to Google calendar, nothing more to ask."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent 👌"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This helps me get everything in one place under the subject needed and allows me to get rid of paper slips laying around everywhere. I love this app!!! Gets me organized and to have less clutter. Marvelous!!!"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It works well"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Trying to manage life with ADD can be a struggle those without it can barely begin to understand. This is much more efficient than all other apps I've tried using to keep life organized. Google calendar, tasks and keep notes are all I use and can sync up together and be shared by individual note, task, date. Love this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Add an option to reorder the lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's a great task manager, one request though. Do you believe you can add recurring tasks for each day? Or where we can set a custom timer?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Tasks is easy to use and I use an add on that let's me see all the lists on a board on my desktop.everthing sinks"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Task support me to work with ease and grace"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good easy to use app. Write list title, put stuff in sublist attached to title, can split list or save for later and put date to reminder on phone is useful of ppl have Google as their platform. Pity you can't highlight or underline stuff you are working on completing but the done function is good that it keeps the completed content available to review afterwards for a period. Also like that a to-do list has 24hr time/date for appointments, meetings, exercise etc... Nice n simple."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it! Love the interface between everything. Google."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Love Google tasks however it's so behind with regards to a lack of basic features. Would love to see -Shared tasks(not including spaces or workspace) -add attachments/images -shared tasks with ownership options -reoccurring tasks -task with the options of adding a timer on it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"When you depend on the app it stops showing notifications. I missed so many things because of this."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I want to try this"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple to create lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I am really satisfied with this app andI really love it! But I suggest you to add one customization to this app and that is making the above tasks list bar sortable so we can move our important lists to the front. Thank you, Regards, Atif."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Cannot understand easily... Otherwise ok ."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great and lightweight app"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Enable the Search Feature, dear 'Task' team. Please. All my friends and me having problem regarding this same thing. Please"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's very helpful."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and straightforward"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great and easy tool to use."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice simple app that's not overly complicated."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I love being able to set recurring tasks. It makes planning my weeks effortless. I do wish there was a way to change the views on the calendar. I love seeing them when I look at my day, but on the month view it's overwhelming with all the other events, birthdays, and holidays. This is misleading for what you really have going on, especially when the tasks are quick and easy. I could use reminders, but I've found I don't get notifications like I do with tasks and end up missing them."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love this app. It's simple and easy to use. Also, I can change the lists when I added its widget."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Awesome app love it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This app works absolutely fine and it's easy to operate. 👍👍"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"King fito"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Okay 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Don't use this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love my account with Google pay"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It's the first thing I open in the morning. I wish it had something like reminder notifications"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I like the clean UI of the app but it is definitely lacking some basic features like labels. Also, from brand like Google which keeps pushing the limits of AI I woul expect to have smart language recognition just like todoist."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"HIGHLY USEFUL"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and useful task management app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"No issues so far. Can make sub tasks and set due dates and times. Can add notes to tasks at any time as well. Use it across multiple devices."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Suggestions Task List - is good support but move option required as priority. So we can move task list as my priority"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I could really use a better nudging process, algorithm, whatever. I wish it showed up on the -1 page."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Hi.. how exactly can we sync the task here to ggl calendar?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps when you have so much to remember."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So far so good!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"No lament here . It quick and easy to be constructive using this App."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Perfect in everything except that when I add a new task, it automatically goes to the top instead of the bottom of the list, which doesn't make much sense because a new task would most likely need to be done after a current task, so it should be located after. There's no way to change this so every time I add a new task I have to manually drag it to the bottom."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helps me keep up with school work, love it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good at helping you to be organized but wish I could have a postpone option for the tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good app, would be great if tasks or lists could be shared with others.."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works in sync with my other devices, sync works well. Also use it for immediate notes while put and about. Thinking how to sync with voice to make it more versatile."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, organization is good enough for s/o who likes to categorize, and subcategories. More levels of subtasks would please my obsessiveness"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I wish it had more features, such as an easier eay to add daily tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Should sync with Google Assistant and add a feature on Fitbit"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"it really needs to be integrated with Google assistant to be of better use..."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It keeps me organized. Best option since my Franklin Planner. Love it. Thank you! Posted this 2 years ago, and its still true. Use it daily."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Useful app to manage daily routine."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Just like it!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app! Love it!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Exceptional app! I wish there was a way to mark tasks as failed, if they weren't accomplished. Instead of just deleting them entirely."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Google is ethical. This is Google's SUPERPOWER and it will outsmart it's competition everytime. People all over the world trust Google products. Methinks (A cleaner and better to-do app)"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Simple, easy, on point, useful. Can we please get a desktop version? I'd like to have google tasks on my computer, synchronized with my phone, please. Or if it already exists, I can't seem to find it. So maybe add it in a more visible place."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy UI and good app 👍👍👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"App will be more useful if Voice alarm activated"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Its interface is like google calendar Please lncrease it graphical view quailty Like checking square for detail of every task"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Nice app, works well with calendar. Recurring tasks are a bit funky since you can't see the recurring task until the day of which doesn't help much for planning ahead."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very useful for reminders across my Google apps, phone, Chromebook"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very helpful and easy to use. I am getting things done."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like it but it could use some freedom to design the app for personal use"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Comes in handy"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"For a simple, easy to create and use list, there is no better app. And it also has to be mentioned - syncing notes between devices couldn't be simpler."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use, Google is great."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Tasks simplifies my to do lists and allows me to have them accessible anywhere. Great organizational tool."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I wish I could change the order of the task lists, instead of them just being stuck in the order I created them. I also wish I could share tasks with other people."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Amazingly awesome"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's simple and does the job. I used to use Google Sheets to keep my to-do list. This cuts out a few keystrokes."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Google tasks deleted my tasks twice and couldn't recover them"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It is good for personal use. One big feature that is missing will be if one could attach different people for the same task. So that they also know about the task. Collaboration is required in tasks. Please integrate that."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Savings lots of time using this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Just started will update later."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It works. It's not the most robust featured task manager, but it gets the job done. The most lacking piece is it's lack of integration with the Google Assistant"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"The app doesn't show push notifications? It doesn't. It doesn't sync with the cloud to fetch tasks created on other devices except you open the app by yourself. Again, it doesn't show push notifs and I have no idea why. Yes, my notifications are enabled in Settings. There are Google Support and Reddit threads with people complaining about the notif problem. EDIT: The notifs are showing now."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Dont find it useful."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Tasks are but more customization required"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very well"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Everything is good apart from subtasks not being functional when a task is repeated (and vice versa). It also seems that the reminders feature does not link with Google assistant reminder feature. Also the reminder list is redundant if it just behaves like tasks; reminders should remind you of the task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"So far loving it. Just what I needed"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Wish I could share lists with other people like I can in Google Keep."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"New to doing this but I love it. I love that i can put my tasks into categories. I have tasks for household, farm and school so far. I also like how tasks are deleted once completed. Goodbye to my yellow legal pad! User friendly. Im 57."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"A very useful app for productivity. There should be an option to indicate that an appointment was cancelled. Currently cancelled appointments are indicated as completed. Formatting of characters including use of colors would be great. That could earn the app five stars. Three for now."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I helps me to do follow up with my customers"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"Lay out could be more easy to read. Subtask with smaller letter tasks in boxes. For Visualy oriented people. Lacking better system of reminders and lists are not possible to move and changing positions on mobile device."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Really like this app. Very simple, straight forward, functional. Like that you can put notes and sub categories for each task. Also like that it doesn't have to be linked to a date but rather putting a date is an option"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easily manageable and simple UI"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Would like to see these items in Google Calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Better would b Fullscreen online option"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Fantastic, lightweight app"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple to use; seems to do what I need. That's all I want, so we're good here."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app, but it needs more customization options."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Easy to use and I love that it integrates with GMAIL, Google Docs, etc and syncs across all my devices. Could benefit from additional functionality such as the ability to creat multilevel subtasks beyond the current task, subtask set up."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Does the job simply and well"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Helps keep me on track on job and at home!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best task app! Thank you!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app for reminding me all types of tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"I don't like that the sorted view makes all sub tasks at the same level as the original main tasks! Not going to use it anymore for this reason."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good. Linked to calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love this app, so handy and sync's with everything on Google 👌🏼"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Much better replacement over Microsoft tasks, don't wanna keep supporting a company that's against huma rights and Google Tasks works perfectly for me so far. I definitely recommend using this if you have multiple lists, but you want to see them all on one screen."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Started using the app along with Microsoft to do. Both are good. Just would like to have a feature of grabbing screen shots and voice recording. A good job done."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's a very good list app, I love it's integration with Gmail. At the same time it's also nothing special. Don't look here for advanced features or a robust system. That's not it's purpose, it's not googles project manager software. But it is good for keeping track of personal to dos."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Using gives me more advantage on other media platforms ahead of everyone else who is racing for data information on baseball.

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great App. 👍"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Everyone can use this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Rockey...✔"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Useful. It would be nice if you could collapse or uncollapse the subtasks under a main heading when you're on your phone I can't figure out how to do that thank you."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Pros: Simple to use and interacts well with Google Calendar i.e. you can see/add tasks in calendar. You can also add subtasks to break tasks down into steps. Con: If you have recurring tasks, they don't always show until the last minute in the task list. Suggestions: a colour coordinated priority scheme (e.g. traffic light) would be useful to support prioritisation. It would also be great to be able to assign time to tasks to aid in planning - perhaps this could link with calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Nicely structered uncomplicated & flexible"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",1,"Are you devs still working on this app or what? One of the worst todo app. I'm not even gonna mention what's wrong with app. Please go check Microsoft todo, todoist, ticktick etc. And try add 10% of their features into this app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Great app I like it but add more option like to attach documents or image - something like that. Also make a good Note making app because google Keep so 👎 bad."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and so useful! Game Changer. Would appreciate it if you could find a way to let me share my tasks / lists with other Gmail accounts"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Do not like ads"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I would suggest no one to get this app you can't even remove it there's not an uninstall option and it comes up every 5 minutes if 5 minutes so if you know what's good for you don't even experience this I couldn't answer calls delayed my phone stalled stalled my phone out horrible and the the battery were out and no time at all hard to keep it charged and galore I mean there was absolutely nothing good about it"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple and useful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Works well enough, but seems barebones and doesn't Integrate well with other apps."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Tasks works well for me. It has scope for a lot of complexity across lists and items with sub items. The one thing it still doesn't let me do is position/order my different lists as I like."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Find this very useful. Would be helpful to be able to add a photo and a bookmark. The repeat function doesn't seem to work but that could well be user inefficiency."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helpful app for anyone who's interested in keeping track of daily tasks or even a one time task while saving time. You can add tasks straight from your emails or you can manually add tasks by pressing the Google + button. Simple, clean app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"😍 amazing 🤩"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"USEFUL FOR YOUR MANAGEMENT OF TIME"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Gr8 reminder"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Really easy to use and user friendly. Would however be nice to see all tasks due for the day from accross all lists on one page."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's a very nice simple task manager, does what i need. But notifications don't show when i program to, sometimes for many days. Please fix."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"App is very useful in the phone, but it needs to be its own program on the desktop I.e. split off Gmail for more screen space."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Does what I want it to. Simps"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Es muy útil pero no me llegan las notificaciones de tareas con horarios que yo fijo hasta que abro la app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I like the simplicity of it. I would like to be able to share the tasks with someone else, just like I'm able to share a Google doc. I would also like to see a search button, so I can reuse the list over and over. For example, I tried using it as a grocery shopping list, so after I buy milk, I check it off the list, but next week, when I need to buy it again, I would like a search box where I start typing the word ""milk"" and the checked off milk item appears, I uncheck it, and reuse it."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simple to use and I'm booking more task because of it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's 100% user friendly. I've accomplished a lot of goals since I started using this app."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It's simple and effective. No fuss."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent learning tool. Need this to maintain order with my busyness . Thanks"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Could you add sort alphabetically option please?"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This application has helped me organize my task so well I feel like there isn't another app that can stand up to this one with its compatibility with Google services."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Helpfull"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"This App would be perfect if it had a Notification Alarm, and with a choice of different sounds! Plus, when you've marked off one of your Repeated Reminders, it also marks off all the future Reminders along with it?! Other than that, it's a great little App! Can you please fix the Reminder problem and add the Alarm feature? And I will definitely give it Five Stars and re-download the App! Thank you and have a blessed day"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is the easiest way for me to stay organized."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it. Makes tracking work, and personal tasks easier."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Calendar integration and phone notifications are very convenient. I especially like that I can separate work from home and make sublists if needed. I've been adding a date for every task so they appear in my Google calendar, which makes it easier to keep track if small items, and adjusting dates as needed is easy. Setting work task due dates for Friday only is a good way to lump them for the week."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love the widget. Checking completed tasks is a breeze. Having multiple lists and sub tasks is what I was looking for"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Very handy and simple to use. I dislike that recurring tasks don't retain the new title after you re-name it. And on rare occasions, sometimes updated 'details' added to an existing task disappear."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very useful for easily organising tasks and to do's"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I like it ,its simple , I wish I could share some tasks with my family members"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I really like this app as a widget. I get really bad anxiety when I feel like i have a lot of tasks and I get overwhelmed when they're just floating in my head. Being able to write them down, categorize them, prioritize them, and eliminate them has really helped with my task management and helped me sleep better at night...literally lol."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Everything I was looking for. Depends on what a person is looking and for me it's perfect"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like the easy intuitive use of this app. I really like how I can connect the tasks to my Google calendar with ease. I like how I can easily forward an email to my tasks app for those timeds when someone emails something I need to do. It's nice that I can put due dates on some tasks and leave other tasks as just lists with no dates. I wish I could integrate all my Google accounts into one task list on my app."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"I'd like to be able to schedule sub tasks on progressive dates and have them display on those dates. i.e. sub task 1 tomorrow, 2 in 3 days, 4 in 1 week with top level task due in 2 weeks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very good the way it sync, my wife and I share a google account so we can both see tasks."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Better than pen and paper because it syncs to the cloud and meshes with my calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very simple and useful. I wished I could make a task remind me every other day but the best I can do is weekly. I also wished I could have an option to ""postpone"" the task. But neither the less it's very nice and dependable."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I use it every day. I also recommend the Chrome extension."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Brilliant"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Enjoy the layout over other apps."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Nice app is this"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Comfortable and efficient"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Been using this for almost 3 years now and it is so reliable especially for school works and such. It notifies you and the app itself is just straight to the point- taking notes/schedule."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love it for its simplicity and how it integrates with Google Calendar. I've used more sophisticated task management tools, but with those I spent more time playing with ways to organize my tasks than actually getting them done. I also love how it integrates with Gmail: I can create a follow-up task from any email and the body of the email automatically goes into the task."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Just received this app but Love it so far. Like it because it connected to calendar"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"love it! i used to be a die-hard paper planner fan, but this switched me! i love the integration with GCal and other GSuite apps. it's been a game changer for my adhd!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Great app! I use it daily for my various chores. Keeping track of everything"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Works well on its own or with Google calendar. If you use Google calendar and you have a task with a date it pops up at the top calendar."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Not bad"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"It needs a natural language process like todoist. There is no dedicated website."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",2,"I WANT to use Google Tasks integrated with other Google apps. But I hate that it spreads tasks out so that I can only see 5 tasks on my whole tablet screen. I want to scan a significant list of tasks in a compact list view. I already know what's in them I don't need to see several lines of details for each task. And couldn't due dates be BESIDE tasks rather than above them (future) or below them (overdue)? I can't find any setting options to do these things. Can anyone help?"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"bad desktop GUI in Callender and lacks a windows app like most Google products"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"You guys should add date to each task it will be important, just a suggestion"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Have you any earning money plan in this task what ur mind about this ap please if my tasks complete by me please answer me"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Mostly love it. It would be nice if subtasks could have due dates separately."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good, could be improved by allowing better interoperability between accounts and allowing better calendaring but great idea."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I like it because it's simple. When I move to a fuller featured app, it gets complicated so I stop using it. I do wish I could see and sort my lists all together in one master list."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"It is ok man."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"In disbelief that there isn't a way to see all tasks from all categories at the same time. Still."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Impressive development"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"Need an option to make a copy like keep. Also the option to choose different ring tones for each category of tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The only app I use to stay organized"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"A great tool for making reminders and staying organized. It's very straightforward and useful, and it's completely free with no ads!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Great app to organize lists for tasks, errands, shopping, etc."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Perfect Very simple"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"This is the handy notepad I've been wanting where I can keep family or business notes on separate lists"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Excellent App"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Dear members of Google Tasks Team, I want to know whether Google Tasks' App data is counted against free data limit of 15GB per Google Account and/or in case of, Google ONE membership account holders, the ibid App's data is counted against the total data limit purchased by the GoogleOne member. Will always remain Thankful for your clarification on this matter. Again Congratulations & Thank you for a simple and intuitive, yet powerful productivity App. Thank You, in anticipation of a sure answer."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best task app I've tried"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"গুড"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Almost exactly what I need. If I could also share my tank lists and assign them locations like you can in Google keep, tasks would be perfect for my needs. It is much easier to use than keep, easier to access being right beside Gmail and gcalendar. Gkeep has more features that complicate the app but I need a couple of those features. Oh, multiple levels of nested tasks would be great too. That way I could plan out a project and track progress in tasks shared with my team."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"The ability to 'convert' an email to a task changed my life. The simplicity of setting a due date/reminder for each item is literally responsible for my sanity!"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Almost as simple as making a list on paper. Also just as easy to ignore. Hopefully, adding the widget to my home screen will help."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",3,"The notification system is faulty"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Just amazing asf"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"It's a very helpful app, and it would be better if sorting tasks by name feature was available."

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Overall it works for me."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Describe"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Generally like it, but it needs a way to declutter long lists of tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Just asowem"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Nice but it would be better if there is a function where users can change color of tasks and also allows us to put duration for each task like an event on calendar."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Best App Ever as it is fully integrated with Gmail... but I would like you to add the feature of adding task via Gmail Android App also... than the usage on the Go will increase the productivity and ease.. Right Now adding task via Gmail is only thru web"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Comes in very handy, remember something, then just write it down, continue with what you are doing, and finish the task later."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Very nice:)*"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"I've jus started using it"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Almost as good as a written list/note!"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"I love it. It's convenient and simple and the widget is great"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Not intuitive or easy to use. Needs some instructions on how to enter, erase, édit, change date, keep ...etc"

"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Good lightweight phone integration for Google tasks"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",4,"Suggestion - I wish there was a ""Save"" option along with the ""Mark as Complete"" one. My back button happens to be just below the Mark as Complete button, causing the occasional mistake in completing a task when I only wanted to save the changes. Otherwise, decent app for it's ease of use, reliability, and syncing feature. I use it to keep track of bills, subscriptions, and other reminders."
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Love it. Toilet friendly 😉"
"Google Tasks","Unknown",5,"Simples, mas muito útil"
